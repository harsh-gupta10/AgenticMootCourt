Petitioner: May it please your Lordship, the counsel seeks permission to approach the dais.

Judge: : <None>
Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.Good morning, your Lordship. The counsel recognizes the gracious presence of this Hon’ble Court. For the convenience of these proceedings, may the counsel refer to your Lordship as such?

Judge: : <None>
Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.The counsel is appearing before this Hon’ble Court in the matter of PQR & Ors. v. State of Mahadpur, under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, challenging the constitutionality of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976 as amended on 4th November 2016.

Judge: : What are the primary grounds on which you challenge the constitutionality of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, as amended?
Petitioner: Much obliged, Your Lordship.

The primary grounds on which the constitutionality of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, as amended, is challenged are as follows:

1. **Violation of Article 21 – Right to Privacy and Choice**
Your Lordship, Sections 5A to 5D of the amended Act impose a blanket prohibition on the possession, transportation, import, and consumption of beef, even if lawfully slaughtered outside the State. This infringes upon the individual's right to privacy and personal autonomy, which forms an essential part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. This Hon’ble Court in *K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* has explicitly recognised that the right to food choice and autonomy in private matters falls within the ambit of privacy.

2. **Violation of Article 21 – Reverse Burden of Proof**
Section 9B places the burden on the accused to prove that possession or transportation was not in contravention of the law, contrary to the settled principle of criminal jurisprudence — “innocent until proven guilty.” This reverse burden is arbitrary, disproportionate, and fails the test of fairness under Article 21.

3. **Violation of Article 19(1)(g) – Freedom of Trade and Occupation**
The amendment has had a severe economic impact on licensed traders, slaughterhouses, and those in the meat and leather industries. The total ban is neither reasonable nor proportionate, and it cripples lawful trade and business protected under Article 19(1)(g).

4. **Violation of Article 25 and Article 29 – Religious and Cultural Rights**
Your Lordship, certain communities for whom consumption of such meat is customary and religiously permitted are being deprived of their fundamental right to practice and propagate their religion and culture. The total ban imposes a uniform dietary code that suppresses minority practices, violating Articles 25 and 29.

These grounds, taken together, make it evident that the impugned amendments are not only excessive and disproportionate but also fail the constitutional tests of reasonableness, fairness, and non-discrimination.

Judge: : <None>
Petitioner: Your Lordship, the present matter raises the following critical issues for determination:

Whether the amendment to the MPA Act, 1976 violates the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g), 21, 25, and 29 of the Constitution of India.

Whether the reverse burden of proof under Section 9-B of the amended Act is violative of the principle of presumption of innocence under Article 21.

The counsel shall now proceed to address these issues, if your Lordship so permits.

Judge: : What specific evidence demonstrates the severe economic impact on licensed traders, slaughterhouses, and those in the meat and leather industries due to the amendment?
Petitioner: Much obliged, Your Lordship.

In response to Your Lordship’s query regarding specific evidence of the severe economic impact, the Petitioners rely on the following:

Documented Economic Displacement
Multiple affidavits and representations submitted before the Hon’ble High Court by members of the Slaughter Houses Association demonstrate that licensed slaughterhouses had to cease operations entirely due to the total ban. This includes evidence of:

Permanent layoffs of butchers and auxiliary workers.

Closure of supply chains that provided feed, veterinary care, and meat packaging.

Loss of Livelihoods in Ancillary Trades
The leather and hide industries, which primarily use by-products of cattle slaughter, reported sharp declines in raw material supply. Industry associations submitted data showing that the cost of sourcing hides from outside the state became economically unviable, leading to reduced production and exports. This had a ripple effect on tanning units, small-scale artisans, and exporters.

Impact on Informal Sector
The Petitioners also refer to field surveys and NGO reports that highlight how migrant and daily-wage workers, primarily employed in meat transport and retail, lost their income sources overnight. The unorganized sector, Your Lordship, is most vulnerable and has little legal or financial recourse to such sweeping disruptions.

Absence of Transitional or Compensatory Measures
No rehabilitation scheme, subsidy, or financial buffer was offered by the State of Mahadpur to the affected parties. In State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamaat, this Hon’ble Court observed that reasonable restrictions must not disproportionately affect a particular class without compensatory safeguards. In the present case, the absence of such a cushion further strengthens the argument of disproportionality and arbitrariness.

The economic consequences, therefore, are not speculative but substantiated by real, material, and demonstrable losses, particularly to communities and professions protected under Article 19(1)(g).

Judge: : What specific data or metrics were used to quantify the "sharp declines" in raw material supply to the leather and hide industries?
Petitioner: Much obliged, Your Lordship.

To quantify the sharp declines in raw material supply, the Petitioners place reliance on the following specific data and metrics, which were collected and submitted through industry representations and affidavits:

Pre- and Post-Amendment Procurement Volumes
The Mahadpur Leather Traders Association, in its affidavit, presented monthly procurement logs from licensed tanneries. It showed that:

Pre-amendment (July to October 2016): An average of 3,500 hides/month were sourced from within Mahadpur.

Post-amendment (November 2016 to February 2017): The figure dropped to less than 800 hides/month, marking a decline of over 75%.

Production Downtime Reports
Several small and medium-scale tanneries submitted internal operational logs indicating:

20 to 40 days of inactivity per quarter due to shortage of raw hides.

Reduced batch sizes in processing due to unpredictable supply and rising transport costs from out-of-state procurement.

Revenue Statements and Export Losses
Leather cooperatives submitted comparative revenue charts, revealing:

A 35% decrease in quarterly revenue post-amendment, attributed directly to reduced hide availability.

Cancellation of export orders due to failure to meet volume commitments, corroborated by invoice trails and correspondence with overseas buyers.

Market Substitution Effect
Data from the All-India Leather Export Council indicated that states neighboring Mahadpur—which earlier depended on Mahadpur for intermediary hides—saw a 10–15% increase in procurement costs, thereby reducing competitiveness in international markets.

Your Lordship, the above data was either annexed to affidavits or cited in industry white papers submitted along with the writ petitions. This empirical loss not only highlights the amendment’s disproportional economic fallout, but also underlines its inconsistency with Article 19(1)(g), especially in the absence of a phased implementation or compensatory provision

Judge: : What methodology was employed to collect the data presented regarding the decline in raw material supply, and can you provide details on the validation process used to ensure its accuracy?
Petitioner: Much obliged, Your Lordship.

Methodology of Data Collection:

Affidavits from Industry Stakeholders
The primary method involved the collection of sworn affidavits from licensed slaughterhouses, tanneries, and trade associations across Mahadpur. These affidavits contained:

Inventory logs from pre- and post-amendment periods.

Sales and procurement invoices.

Employment rosters and production timelines.

Judge: : `<None>`
Petitioner: Shall the counsel proceed with a brief statement of facts, or would your Lordship prefer to move directly to the arguments?

Judge: : <None>
Petitioner: Your Lordship, the brief facts of the case are as follows:

The State of Mahadpur, by an amendment dated 4th November 2016, brought changes to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976. This amendment introduced Sections 5A to 5D, which effectively imposed a total ban on the transportation, slaughter, import, and possession of flesh of cows, bulls, and bullocks, including those slaughtered outside the State of Mahadpur.

Additionally, Sections 9A and 9B of the amendment introduced a statutory reversal of the burden of proof—placing the onus on the accused to prove that the possession or movement of such flesh was not in contravention of the Act.

These amendments were notified in the Mahadpur Gazette on 4th November 2016 and received Presidential assent on the same day.

Following the enactment, a significant section of the public, including slaughterhouse owners, expressed concern over the sweeping nature of the ban. This led to the filing of a Public Interest Litigation by the lead petitioner, PQR, along with a Writ Petition filed by the Slaughter Houses Association before the Hon’ble High Court, challenging the constitutional validity of the amended provisions.

The Hon’ble High Court upheld the amendments. The Petitioners now approach this Hon’ble Court under Article 136, challenging that judgment on the grounds that the amended Act violates fundamental rights.

If your Lordship is well-acquainted with the facts, the counsel seeks permission to proceed with the arguments.

Judge: : `<None>`
Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship. Your Lordship, the first issue pertains to the constitutional validity of the amended provisions of the MPA Act, 1976—specifically Sections 5A to 5D and Section 9B—in light of Articles 21, 19(1)(g), 25, and 29 of the Constitution.
Argument 1: Violation of Article 21 – Right to Privacy and Personal Autonomy

Your Lordship, Article 21 guarantees not just life, but a life with dignity. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India has recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21. This includes decisional autonomy and personal dietary choices.

The impugned provisions, by criminalizing even the possession of beef brought from outside the State, enter the private sphere of individual autonomy and disrupt personal choices, including those made in the privacy of one's home.

In effect, the law compels conformity with a specific dietary standard—not on grounds of public health, but on moral and cultural lines—without offering a legitimate state interest strong enough to override individual liberty.

Judge: : In your view, does the right to privacy under Article 21 extend to protecting dietary choices that may be offensive to certain segments of the population?
Petitioner: Much obliged, Your Lordship.

Yes, in the respectful submission of the Petitioner, the right to privacy under Article 21 most certainly extends to protecting individual dietary choices, even if such choices are perceived as offensive or culturally objectionable to certain sections of the population.
Your Lordship, the landmark judgment in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) unequivocally affirmed that:

“Privacy includes the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation… it includes the right to be left alone.”

Within this broad canvas, choices regarding food—what one eats, when, and how—are personal decisions that fall squarely within the protected domain of privacy and autonomy.

Petitioner: Argument 2: Violation of Article 19(1)(g) – Freedom of Trade and Occupation

Your Lordship, the total ban, especially as it applies to slaughterhouse owners and meat traders, directly impairs the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

While reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6) are permissible, the totality of the ban—extending to even inter-State movement and lawful possession—fails the test of proportionality. The counsel submits that less restrictive alternatives could have served the same purpose.

The Hon’ble Court in Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar upheld bans on cow slaughter only where it was balanced by public interest and did not impose undue hardship on the livelihoods of butchers. Here, even animals lawfully slaughtered in other States fall within the prohibition—a restriction that appears excessive and arbitrary.

Judge: <None>
Petitioner: In light of the above submissions, your Lordship, the amended provisions of the MPA Act, 1976 suffer from unconstitutionality on multiple fronts. They are arbitrary, disproportionate, and incompatible with the values enshrined in Articles 19, 21, 25, and 29 of the Constitution.

The counsel humbly prays that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to strike down Sections 5A to 5D and Section 9B of the Act as being ultra vires the Constitution.

Should your Lordship have any questions or require clarifications, the counsel shall be pleased to address them.

Judge: <None>
The respondent's arguments will now begin.
Judge: : In your view, does the right to privacy under Article 21 extend to protecting dietary choices that may be offensive to certain segments of the population?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I am counsel for the Respondent, the State of Mahadpur, in this matter.

With the Court's kind permission, I would like to begin by addressing the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. This appeal arises from a Special Leave Petition filed under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, challenging the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court which upheld the validity of the amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976. This Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction to hear this appeal, given the substantial questions of law of general importance that arise from the impugned legislation.

May I proceed to state the issues before this Hon'ble Court?

Judge: : <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to outline the key legal issues before this Hon'ble Court.

The primary issues for consideration are as follows:

1.  Whether Sections 5A to 5D of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, as amended, violate Article 21 of the Constitution of India, specifically the right to privacy and choice.

2.  Whether Section 9-B of the said Act, which places the burden of proof on the accused, is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, contravening the presumption of innocence.

3.  Whether the amended provisions infringe upon the fundamental right to freedom of trade and occupation under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

4.  Whether the amendments violate the fundamental right to practice and propagate religion under Article 25, as well as cultural rights under Article 29 of the Constitution.

May I proceed to present our arguments, addressing each issue in turn?

Judge: : <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to address the first issue raised by the petitioners, namely, whether Sections 5A to 5D of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, as amended, violate Article 21 of the Constitution of India, specifically the right to privacy and choice.

May I proceed?

Judge: : Given that the Petitioners argue the ban infringes on personal autonomy, how does the State balance this right with its duty to uphold public order and morality, especially considering the diverse cultural and religious sentiments within Mahadpur?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the State acknowledges the importance of personal autonomy and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution. However, these rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order, morality, and the general welfare.

The State's duty to uphold public order and morality stems from its responsibility to maintain social harmony and prevent actions that could disrupt the peace or offend the deeply held beliefs of a significant portion of its citizenry. In a diverse society like Mahadpur, where cultural and religious sentiments vary widely, the State must act as an impartial arbiter, balancing competing interests to ensure that no single group's rights are prioritized at the expense of others.

The ban on the slaughter of cows, bulls, and bullocks is rooted in the State's understanding of the cultural and religious significance of these animals to a substantial segment of the population. This is not merely a matter of religious practice but also reflects a broader cultural ethos that values the cow as a symbol of reverence and sustenance.

Furthermore, the State's policy is also guided by the Directive Principles of State Policy, particularly Article 48, which enjoins the State to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and, in particular, to take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. While Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by the courts, they provide valuable guidance in interpreting the scope and limitations of fundamental rights.

The State submits that the restrictions imposed by the amended Act are reasonable, proportionate, and necessary to achieve the legitimate aim of preserving public order and morality, as well as protecting the cultural and religious sentiments of a significant section of the population. The State has carefully considered the diverse cultural and religious sentiments within Mahadpur and has strived to strike a balance that respects individual autonomy while upholding the collective good.

May I proceed further, My Lord?

Judge: : <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to proceed with our arguments against the challenge to Section 9-B of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, which pertains to the reverse burden of proof.

May I proceed?

Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the State submits that Section 9-B, which places the burden of proof on the accused, is a reasonable and necessary measure to effectively enforce the provisions of the MPA, 1976, and does not violate Article 21 of the Constitution.

The State acknowledges the general principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, this principle is not absolute and can be subject to exceptions where compelling reasons exist. In the context of the MPA, 1976, the State faces significant challenges in detecting and prosecuting offenses related to the slaughter, transportation, and possession of prohibited animal flesh.

The very nature of these offenses makes it difficult for the prosecution to gather direct evidence. Often, the evidence is circumstantial, and the accused is in a better position to explain the circumstances surrounding the alleged offense. For instance, an individual found transporting cow meat is best placed to explain its origin and intended use.

The reverse burden of proof in Section 9-B is not an insurmountable hurdle for the accused. It merely requires the accused to provide a reasonable explanation or evidence to rebut the presumption that they have violated the law. The burden of proof remains on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 9-B only shifts the initial burden of providing an explanation to the accused.

Furthermore, similar provisions placing the burden of proof on the accused have been upheld by the Courts in cases involving other socio-economic offenses, such as those related to food adulteration and illegal possession of certain goods. These provisions have been justified on the ground that they are necessary to combat activities that are detrimental to public health, safety, and the economy.

The State submits that Section 9-B is a carefully crafted provision that strikes a balance between the rights of the accused and the need to effectively enforce the MPA, 1976. It is a reasonable restriction on the presumption of innocence, justified by the compelling need to protect animal welfare and prevent illegal activities related to the slaughter and trade of prohibited animal flesh.

May I proceed further, My Lord?

Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to address the challenge to the amended provisions on the ground that they violate Article 19(1)(g), the fundamental right to freedom of trade.

May I proceed?

Judge: : May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to address the challenge to the amended provisions on the ground that they violate Article 19(1)(g), the fundamental right to freedom of trade.

May I proceed?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the State submits that the amended provisions of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, do not violate Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, which guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of trade and occupation.

The State acknowledges that the amended Act imposes certain restrictions on the trade and occupation related to the slaughter, transportation, and sale of cow, bull, and bullock flesh. However, these restrictions are reasonable and are imposed in the interest of the general public, falling within the ambit of Article 19(6) of the Constitution.

The State's policy is aimed at preserving and protecting animal wealth, which is a vital part of the agricultural economy. The ban on the slaughter of cows, bulls, and bullocks is intended to ensure the availability of these animals for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing, irrigation, and transportation. These animals are also a source of milk, manure, and other valuable products that contribute to the rural economy.

The restrictions imposed by the amended Act are not absolute. They only apply to the slaughter, transportation, and sale of cow, bull, and bullock flesh. Other forms of trade and occupation related to animal husbandry are not affected. Furthermore, the restrictions are limited to the State of Mahadpur and do not prevent individuals from engaging in these activities in other states where they are permitted.

The State has taken into consideration the economic impact of the restrictions on those who are engaged in the trade and occupation related to the slaughter, transportation, and sale of cow, bull, and bullock flesh. However, the State believes that the larger public interest in preserving and protecting animal wealth outweighs the individual interests of these individuals.

The State submits that the restrictions imposed by the amended Act are reasonable, proportionate, and necessary to achieve the legitimate aim of preserving and protecting animal wealth, which is essential for the agricultural economy and the general welfare of the people of Mahadpur. The restrictions are not arbitrary or excessive and do not unduly infringe upon the fundamental right to freedom of trade and occupation.

May I proceed further, My Lord?

Judge: Agent stopped due to max iterations.
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to address the final challenge regarding the violation of the fundamental right to practice and propagate religion under Article 25, as well as cultural rights under Article 29 of the Constitution.

May I proceed?

Judge: : May it please Your Lordship, before you proceed, could you elaborate on how the State balances the restrictions on the slaughter, transportation, and sale of cow, bull, and bullock flesh with the potential impact on the religious or cultural practices of communities for whom beef consumption may be a part of their traditions?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the State submits that the amended provisions of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, do not violate the fundamental right to practice and propagate religion under Article 25, nor do they infringe upon the cultural rights guaranteed under Article 29 of the Constitution.

The petitioners argue that the ban on the slaughter of cows, bulls, and bullocks interferes with the religious practices of communities for whom beef consumption is a part of their tradition. However, the State contends that the restrictions imposed by the amended Act are not aimed at suppressing any particular religion or culture. The primary objective is to protect and preserve animal wealth, which is a matter of secular concern.

Article 25 guarantees the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, and health. The State's policy of protecting cows, bulls, and bullocks is based on considerations of public order, morality, and the economic well-being of the society. It is not intended to discriminate against any particular religion or to impose the religious beliefs of one group upon others.

Furthermore, Article 29 protects the right of any section of citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own to conserve the same. The State acknowledges the importance of preserving cultural diversity. However, the right to conserve culture does not extend to practices that are detrimental to public order, morality, or the health and economic well-being of the society. The ban on cow slaughter is a measure designed to promote the economic welfare of the State and does not target any specific cultural group.

The State submits that the restrictions imposed by the amended Act are reasonable and are necessary to achieve the legitimate aim of protecting animal wealth and promoting the economic well-being of the society. These restrictions do not unduly interfere with the fundamental right to practice and propagate religion or the cultural rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

May it please Your Lordship, with the Court's permission, I would like to conclude by summarizing our arguments and making our final prayer.

May I proceed?

Judge: : <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I seek permission to conclude by summarizing our arguments and making our final prayer.

May I proceed?

Judge: : <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the State respectfully submits that the amended provisions of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, are constitutionally valid and do not violate any of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The restrictions imposed by the Act are reasonable, proportionate, and necessary to achieve the legitimate aims of preserving animal wealth, promoting public order and morality, and protecting the economic well-being of the society.

For the reasons stated above, the State respectfully prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to dismiss the Special Leave Petition and uphold the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court, affirming the validity of the amended provisions of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976.
