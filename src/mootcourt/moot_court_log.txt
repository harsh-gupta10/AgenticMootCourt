Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the counsel appears in PQR & Ors v. State of Mahadpur on behalf of the Respondent, the State of Mahadpur, defending the amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
Judge: Counsel, while Article 32 provides a remedy for the violation of fundamental rights, your argument focuses on the defense of the amendments.  Can you explain how the State's actions in enacting these amendments are consistent with the spirit and intent of Article 32, which is primarily concerned with the enforcement of fundamental rights, not their limitation?
Respondent: Your Lordship, while Article 32 primarily concerns the enforcement of fundamental rights, its application isn't limited to situations where rights are only being protected.  The State's power to enact laws, even those that may incidentally restrict certain fundamental rights, is inherent in its sovereign capacity to maintain public order and welfare.  The amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, are a justifiable exercise of this power, aimed at protecting animal welfare, a matter of significant public interest.  The restrictions imposed are, we submit, reasonable and proportionate, and ultimately contribute to a society where fundamental rights can be enjoyed more effectively.  We will demonstrate this through our arguments on reasonable restrictions and proportionality.
Judge: Counsel, you mentioned that the restrictions imposed by the amendments are reasonable and proportionate.  Can you specify which specific tests of proportionality you believe are satisfied in this case, and how those tests apply to the restrictions on Articles 19(1)(g), 21, 25, and 29?
Respondent: Your Lordship, the amendments satisfy the proportionality test as articulated in various Supreme Court judgments.  Regarding Article 19(1)(g), the restriction on the trade of cow, bull, and bullock flesh is suitable to achieve the legitimate aim of protecting animal welfare. It is necessary, as less restrictive measures would be ineffective in preventing widespread animal cruelty.  The balance between the restriction and the right is achieved by considering the significant public interest in animal welfare against the economic interests of a limited number of individuals involved in the trade.  The same rationale applies to Article 21, where the restriction on personal choice is balanced against the State's duty to protect animal life, a crucial aspect of public health and welfare.  With respect to Articles 25 and 29, while the amendments may incidentally affect religious practices, the restriction is not targeted at religious freedom itself. The State's interest in animal welfare outweighs any potential infringement on religious practices, particularly given the availability of alternative means of religious expression.  We submit that the restrictions are not disproportionate and are justified under the circumstances.
Judge: Counsel, you mentioned the proportionality test.  Can you cite a Supreme Court case that explicitly defines the elements of this test and how it has been applied in a similar context involving restrictions on fundamental rights?
Respondent: Your Lordship, in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India*, the Supreme Court established a three-pronged proportionality test:  a) the existence of a valid law; b) the restriction's necessity to achieve a legitimate aim; and c) proportionality between the means and the aim.  The amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act satisfy this test. The Act is a validly enacted law.  The legitimate aim is the protection of animal welfare, a compelling state interest.  Finally, the complete ban, while restrictive, is proportionate because less restrictive measures would be insufficient to achieve the desired outcome of preventing widespread animal cruelty.  The potential impact on Articles 19(1)(g), 21, 25, and 29 is outweighed by the compelling state interest in animal welfare.
Judge: Counsel, you've cited *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy* and the three-pronged proportionality test. However, the amendments introduce Sections 9A and 9B, shifting the burden of proof to the accused. How does this alteration affect the proportionality analysis, particularly concerning the fairness and reasonableness of the restrictions imposed on Articles 19(1)(g) and 21?
Respondent: Your Lordship, while the shift in burden of proof to the accused in Sections 9A and 9B might appear to alter the balance, it is justified in the context of the specific challenges in proving illegal slaughter and transportation of animals.  The nature of these crimes often involves clandestine operations, making it difficult for the prosecution to gather sufficient evidence to meet the traditional burden of proof.  This shift does not render the law unreasonable or disproportionate, as the State's compelling interest in protecting animal welfare remains paramount.  The potential for misuse is mitigated by the existing judicial safeguards and the requirement for the prosecution to still establish a prima facie case.  The overall proportionality of the restriction remains intact, considering the significant public interest in preventing animal cruelty.
