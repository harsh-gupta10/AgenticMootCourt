The respondent's arguments will now begin.
Judge: <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I am \[Counsel's Name], representing the Respondent, the State of Mahadpur, in this matter of PQR & Ors v. State of Mahadpur.

With the Court's kind permission, I would like to address the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court to adjudicate on the matter, specifically concerning the constitutional validity of the amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976.

Judge: What specific aspects of the amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, lead you to question this Court's jurisdiction to adjudicate on their constitutional validity?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The challenge to this Court's jurisdiction arises from the nature of the amendments themselves and their grounding in the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, which mandates the State to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and, in particular, to take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.

The amendments, therefore, are not merely about restricting trade or infringing on personal choice, but about implementing a constitutional directive. The State, in enacting these amendments, acted within its legislative competence, guided by the constitutional mandate to protect and preserve animal resources.

Therefore, the question before this Court is not simply whether the restrictions imposed are reasonable, but whether the State has acted in furtherance of its constitutional obligations. This distinction is crucial in determining the scope of judicial review and the extent to which this Court can interfere with the legislative choices made by the State in fulfilling its constitutional duties.

May I proceed to the statement of issues, Your Lordship?

Judge: How does the grounding of the amendments in the Directive Principles of State Policy specifically limit this Court's jurisdiction to review their constitutional validity, especially considering the fundamental rights arguments presented by the petitioners?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The grounding of the amendments in the Directive Principles, specifically Article 48, does not entirely limit this Court's jurisdiction. While the State is obligated to implement these principles, such implementation must be balanced against the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.

The relationship between Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights is not one of absolute subordination. As established in Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1980) 3 SCC 625, the harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles is an essential feature of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Court has the power to determine whether the balance has been maintained, and whether the implementation of Directive Principles unduly infringes upon Fundamental Rights.

The petitioners argue that the amendments violate Articles 19(1)(g), 21, 25, and 29. These are justiciable rights, and this Court has the duty to examine whether the restrictions imposed by the amendments are reasonable and proportionate, even if the amendments are aimed at fulfilling a Directive Principle. The burden of proof placed on the accused by Sections 9A and 9B also warrants scrutiny under Article 21.

Therefore, while the Directive Principles provide a justification for the law, they do not immunize it from judicial review, especially when fundamental rights are alleged to be violated. The Court retains the jurisdiction to assess the constitutional validity of the amendments in light of the petitioners' claims.

May I proceed to the statement of issues, Your Lordship?

Judge: The Respondent argues that the amendments are grounded in the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, and that this limits the Court's jurisdiction to review their constitutional validity. The Respondent also argues that the State acted within its legislative competence, guided by the constitutional mandate to protect and preserve animal resources. The Respondent claims that the question before the Court is not simply whether the restrictions imposed are reasonable, but whether the State has acted in furtherance of its constitutional obligations.

I need to ask a question to clarify the Respondent's argument.

What specific criteria or legal standards should this Court apply when assessing whether the State has acted "in furtherance of its constitutional obligations" under Article 48, and how do these criteria differ from the standards typically applied when evaluating restrictions on fundamental rights?

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

When assessing whether the State has acted "in furtherance of its constitutional obligations" under Article 48, this Court should apply the following criteria and legal standards:

1.  Nexus and Proportionality: The Court should examine whether there is a direct and demonstrable nexus between the amendments and the objective of Article 48, which is to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines, preserve breeds, and prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. The restrictions imposed must be proportionate to achieving this objective. This means the Court must assess whether the chosen measures are the least restrictive means to achieve the stated goal.

2.  Reasonable Classification: If the law differentiates between types of animals or imposes different restrictions based on such classification, the Court must determine whether the classification is reasonable. This requires that the classification be based on intelligible differentia and that the differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute.

3.  Balancing with Fundamental Rights: The Court must carefully balance the State's obligation under Article 48 with the fundamental rights of citizens, particularly those guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g), 21, 25, and 29. This involves assessing whether the restrictions imposed are reasonable under Article 19(6), whether they unduly infringe upon the right to privacy and personal choice under Article 21, and whether they violate religious and cultural rights under Articles 25 and 29.

4.  Judicial Review of Reasonableness: The Court should scrutinize the reasonableness of the restrictions, considering factors such as the economic impact on those engaged in the trade, the availability of alternative means of livelihood, and the impact on the cultural and religious practices of the communities affected.

These criteria differ from the standards typically applied when evaluating restrictions on fundamental rights in the following ways:

   Focus on State Obligation: When assessing laws enacted under Directive Principles, the Court gives due weight to the State's constitutional obligation to implement those principles. This means the Court acknowledges the State's policy choices and defers to them unless they are manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable.

   Presumption of Constitutionality: There may be a greater presumption of constitutionality when a law is enacted to implement a Directive Principle. This does not mean the law is immune from judicial review, but it does mean the burden is on the petitioners to show that the law is unconstitutional.

   Wider Margin of Appreciation: The State may be given a wider margin of appreciation in determining the means to achieve the objectives of Directive Principles. This means the Court is less likely to substitute its own judgment for that of the legislature, provided the chosen means are reasonably related to the objective.

However, it is crucial to reiterate that the Directive Principles do not override Fundamental Rights. The Court must ensure that the implementation of Directive Principles does not obliterate or excessively infringe upon Fundamental Rights. The ultimate test is whether a harmonious balance has been achieved between the two, as mandated by the basic structure doctrine.

May I proceed to the statement of issues, Your Lordship?

Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

Having addressed the Court's question regarding the criteria for assessing the State's actions under Article 48, and how these criteria relate to the evaluation of restrictions on fundamental rights, I now seek permission to proceed to the statement of issues before this Hon'ble Court.

Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The issues before this Hon'ble Court are as follows:

1.  Whether the amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, imposing a total ban on the transportation, slaughter, import, and possession of cow, bull, and bullock flesh, violate Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business.

2.  Whether the said amendments infringe upon the right to privacy and personal choice guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

3.  Whether the amendments violate the religious and cultural rights protected under Articles 25 and 29 of the Constitution.

4.  Whether Sections 9A and 9B of the amended Act, which place the burden of proof on the accused, violate Article 21 of the Constitution.

May I, with the Court's permission, proceed to present the facts of the case?

Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

With the Court's permission, I would like to proceed to the legal arguments, beginning with the justification for the restrictions imposed under Article 19(1)(g).

Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The restrictions imposed by the amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, on the transportation, slaughter, import, and possession of cow, bull, and bullock flesh, are reasonable restrictions within the meaning of Article 19(6) of the Constitution. These restrictions are necessary to protect and promote the economic well-being of the State, as well as to give effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48.

The cow and its progeny are an integral part of the agricultural economy of Mahadpur. They provide essential inputs for farming, such as draught power, manure, and milk. Protecting these animals is, therefore, directly linked to the economic prosperity of the State's agricultural sector. The ban on slaughter ensures the continued availability of these resources, contributing to the overall economic stability and growth of the region.

Furthermore, the restrictions are aimed at preventing the depletion of valuable animal resources. Unregulated slaughter can lead to a decline in the population of these animals, which would have adverse consequences for agriculture and related industries. By imposing a total ban, the State seeks to conserve these resources for future generations.

The restrictions are also proportionate to the object sought to be achieved. While they may impact the livelihoods of those involved in the trade of cow, bull, and bullock flesh, the larger public interest in protecting the agricultural economy and conserving animal resources outweighs the individual interests of a few traders. The State has a legitimate interest in regulating activities that have a detrimental impact on the overall economy and environment.

May I proceed further, Your Lordship?

Judge: What specific aspects of the amendments does the State consider to be 'reasonable restrictions' under Article 19(6), and how do these restrictions align with the criteria established by the Supreme Court for such restrictions?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

In response to the Court's earlier question, I would like to elaborate on what specific aspects of the amendments the State considers to be 'reasonable restrictions' under Article 19(6), and how these restrictions align with the criteria established by the Supreme Court for such restrictions.

The State submits that the restrictions are 'reasonable' because they strike a balance between the fundamental right to trade and the larger public interest. The Supreme Court, in numerous cases, has laid down guidelines for determining the reasonableness of restrictions. These include:

1.  Proportionality: The restriction must be proportionate to the object sought to be achieved. In the present case, the object is to protect the agricultural economy, conserve animal resources, and promote animal welfare, as mandated by Article 48. The ban on slaughter is a proportionate measure, as it directly addresses the depletion of these resources.

2.  Nexus with the Object: There must be a direct and proximate nexus between the restriction and the object sought to be achieved. The ban on slaughter has a direct nexus with the protection of the agricultural economy, as it ensures the continued availability of draught animals and other essential inputs for farming.

3.  Least Restrictive Means: The restriction must be the least restrictive means of achieving the object. While there may be other ways to protect animal resources, a total ban is the most effective way to prevent unregulated slaughter and ensure the long-term availability of these resources.

4.  Balancing of Interests: The restriction must strike a balance between the individual interests of traders and the larger public interest. While the ban may impact the livelihoods of those involved in the trade of cow, bull, and bullock flesh, the larger public interest in protecting the agricultural economy and conserving animal resources outweighs the individual interests of a few traders.

5.  Duration and Extent: The duration and extent of the restriction must be reasonable. The ban is not indefinite and can be reviewed and modified by the State legislature if circumstances change.

The State submits that the amendments satisfy all these criteria and are, therefore, 'reasonable restrictions' within the meaning of Article 19(6).

Judge: May I proceed further, Your Lordship?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

Having addressed the Court's question regarding the specific aspects of the amendments and their alignment with the criteria established by the Supreme Court for reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6), I seek permission to proceed further and elaborate on the economic justification for the restrictions.


Judge: The Respondent has addressed the Court's question regarding the specific aspects of the amendments and their alignment with the criteria established by the Supreme Court for reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6). The Respondent now seeks permission to proceed further and elaborate on the economic justification for the restrictions.

I need to ask a question to clarify the Respondent's argument.

Given that the State argues the ban is the 'least restrictive means,' can the State provide data or comparative analyses demonstrating that alternative measures, such as regulated slaughterhouses or subsidized animal care, would be insufficient to achieve the stated goals of protecting the agricultural economy and conserving animal resources?

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

With respect, the State acknowledges the Court's inquiry regarding data and comparative analyses. While a comprehensive, quantifiable dataset comparing the ban with alternative measures may not be readily available in the precise format requested, the State can offer the following justifications for why the ban is considered the least restrictive means:

1.  Enforceability: Regulated slaughterhouses and subsidized animal care programs require extensive infrastructure, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms. In a state like Mahadpur, with its vast rural areas and limited resources, effectively enforcing these alternatives would be significantly challenging and prone to corruption and leakage. A total ban, while seemingly stringent, offers a more straightforward and easily enforceable solution.

2.  Preventing Illegal Activities: Even with regulated slaughterhouses, there remains a risk of illegal slaughter and transportation of animals outside the regulated framework. A total ban eliminates this risk entirely, ensuring complete protection of the animals.

3.  Cultural and Religious Sentiments: The cow holds a special place in the cultural and religious sentiments of a significant portion of the population in Mahadpur. Alternative measures may not adequately address these sentiments, as they still involve the slaughter of these animals, albeit in a regulated manner.

4.  Long-Term Impact: Subsidized animal care programs, while seemingly beneficial, may not be sustainable in the long run due to financial constraints and changing priorities. A total ban provides a more permanent and reliable solution for protecting animal resources.

The State respectfully submits that while alternative measures may have some merit, they are not as effective, enforceable, or sustainable as a total ban in achieving the stated goals of protecting the agricultural economy and conserving animal resources, while also respecting the cultural and religious sentiments of the people of Mahadpur. The State has acted in good faith, taking into account the unique circumstances and challenges faced by the region.

Judge: Given that the State argues the ban is the 'least restrictive means,' can the State provide data or comparative analyses demonstrating that alternative measures, such as regulated slaughterhouses or subsidized animal care, would be insufficient to achieve the stated goals of protecting the agricultural economy and conserving animal resources?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

Having addressed the Court's question regarding the justification for considering the ban as the least restrictive means, I seek permission to proceed further and elaborate on the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, and its relevance to the present case.


Judge: Could the State elaborate on the specific reasons why providing concrete data or comparative analyses regarding the effectiveness of alternative measures is not feasible in this case, and what alternative forms of evidence or justification can the State offer to support its claim that the ban is the least restrictive means?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

Having addressed the Court's question regarding the justification for considering the ban as the least restrictive means, I seek permission to proceed further and elaborate on the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, and its relevance to the present case.

Judge: <None>
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The Directive Principles of State Policy, particularly Article 48, provide a constitutional mandate for the State to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines, and to take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.

The amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, are a direct implementation of this constitutional directive. The State, in enacting these amendments, acted within its legislative competence, guided by the constitutional mandate to protect and preserve animal resources.

The Supreme Court has consistently held that while Directive Principles are not directly enforceable by the courts, they are fundamental in the governance of the country and it is the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws. The Court has also recognized that there is no conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles and that they should be interpreted harmoniously.

In the present case, the restrictions imposed by the amendments are aimed at giving effect to Article 48. The State has a legitimate interest in protecting and preserving animal resources, which are essential for the agricultural economy and the well-being of the people of Mahadpur. The restrictions are, therefore, justified as a means of fulfilling the State's constitutional obligations.

May I proceed further, Your Lordship?

Judge: The Respondent has addressed the Court's question regarding the justification for considering the ban as the least restrictive means and now seeks permission to proceed further and elaborate on the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, and its relevance to the present case.

I need to ask a question to clarify the Respondent's argument.

The State argues that the ban is the least restrictive means because alternative measures are difficult to enforce and may not adequately address cultural and religious sentiments. How does the State ensure that the total ban does not disproportionately affect the livelihoods and economic activities of specific communities or individuals, and what measures are in place to mitigate any such disproportionate impact?

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The State acknowledges the Court's concern regarding the potential disproportionate impact of the ban on specific communities or individuals. The State submits that while a complete ban may appear stringent, it is implemented with the following considerations and measures in place to mitigate any such impact:

1.  Rehabilitation and Alternative Livelihood Programs: The State is committed to providing alternative livelihood opportunities for those communities and individuals who may be directly affected by the ban. These programs include assistance in setting up alternative businesses, skill development training, and access to financial resources.

2.  Transition Period: The State has implemented the ban in a phased manner, allowing individuals and communities time to adjust and transition to alternative livelihoods. This transition period is crucial for minimizing disruption and ensuring a smooth transition.

3.  Financial Assistance: The State provides financial assistance to those who may suffer economic hardship as a result of the ban. This assistance is designed to help them meet their basic needs and support their families during the transition period.

4.  Consultation with Affected Communities: The State has engaged in consultations with affected communities to understand their concerns and address their needs. This consultation process is ongoing and helps the State to tailor its mitigation measures to the specific needs of each community.

5.  Review and Modification: The State is committed to reviewing the impact of the ban on a regular basis and making modifications as necessary to minimize any disproportionate impact. This ensures that the ban remains proportionate and does not unduly infringe upon the rights of any particular community or individual.

The State respectfully submits that while the ban may have some impact on specific communities or individuals, the State has taken and continues to take all reasonable steps to mitigate any such impact and ensure that the ban is implemented in a fair and equitable manner.

May I proceed further, Your Lordship?

Judge: The State acknowledges the Court's concern regarding the potential disproportionate impact of the ban on specific communities or individuals. Can the State provide specific, measurable goals and timelines for these mitigation measures, and how will the State ensure accountability in achieving these goals?
Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

The State acknowledges the Court's concern regarding the potential disproportionate impact of the ban on specific communities or individuals. The State can provide the following specific, measurable goals and timelines for these mitigation measures, and how the State will ensure accountability in achieving these goals:

1.  Goal: To provide alternative livelihood opportunities for at least 80% of the affected individuals within one year of the implementation of the ban.
       Timeline: One year.
       Accountability: The Department of Labour and Employment will be responsible for identifying affected individuals, providing skill development training, and facilitating access to financial resources. Progress will be monitored through regular surveys and reports, and the department will be held accountable for achieving the target.

2.  Goal: To provide financial assistance to at least 90% of the affected families within six months of the implementation of the ban.
       Timeline: Six months.
       Accountability: The Department of Social Welfare will be responsible for identifying affected families, disbursing financial assistance, and monitoring the impact of the assistance on their livelihoods. Progress will be monitored through regular audits and reports, and the department will be held accountable for achieving the target.

3.  Goal: To conduct consultations with all affected communities within three months of the implementation of the ban.
       Timeline: Three months.
       Accountability: The Department of Community Affairs will be responsible for organizing consultations with affected communities, gathering feedback, and incorporating their concerns into the mitigation measures. Progress will be monitored through regular reports and community feedback mechanisms, and the department will be held accountable for ensuring that all affected communities are consulted.

4.  Goal: To review and modify the mitigation measures on a quarterly basis, based on feedback from affected communities and monitoring data.
       Timeline: Quarterly.
       Accountability: A committee comprising representatives from the Departments of Labour and Employment, Social Welfare, and Community Affairs will be responsible for reviewing the mitigation measures, making modifications as necessary, and ensuring that the measures remain effective and proportionate. The committee will be held accountable for ensuring that the mitigation measures are regularly reviewed and updated.

The State respectfully submits that these specific, measurable goals and timelines, along with the accountability mechanisms, will ensure that the mitigation measures are effective in addressing any disproportionate impact of the ban on specific communities or individuals.
