Judge: No Questions.
Defender: **III. Affirmative Defense**

**A. Yumana was acting in self-defense.**

**Factual Rebuttal:**

* The prosecution's witnesses have provided conflicting accounts of the incident, casting doubt on the reliability of their testimony.
* Yumana's testimony and physical evidence support her claim that she feared for her life and acted reasonably in defending herself.

**Case Law Citation:**

* State v. Johnson, 200 P.3d 1001 (2009): The defendant's own testimony, coupled with corroborating physical evidence, can establish a self-defense claim.

**Legal Analysis:**

Under the principle of self-defense, an individual is justified in using reasonable force to protect themselves from imminent harm. The prosecution has failed to show that Yumana's use of force was excessive or unreasonable under the circumstances.

* The prosecution's witnesses have testified that Yumana was verbally and physically aggressive prior to the incident, but their accounts are contradicted by Yumana's testimony and the physical evidence.
* Yumana testified that she was in fear of her life when she used force, and this fear was reasonable given the alleged threats and actions of the victim.
* The physical evidence, including photographs of Yumana's injuries, supports her claim that she acted in self-defense.

Therefore, based on the evidence presented, the jury should find that Yumana acted in self-defense and is not guilty of the charges against her.
Judge: No Questions.
Defender: **IV. Affirmative Defense (continued)**

**B. Yumana was acting under the influence of extreme emotional distress**

**Factual Rebuttal:**

* The prosecutor has failed to consider the extreme emotional distress that Yumana was experiencing at the time of the incident.
* Yumana had recently witnessed a traumatic event that left her in a state of shock and fear.
* Her actions were a result of her heightened emotional state, not malice or intent to harm.

**Case Law Citation:**

* People v. Conley, 64 Cal. App. 5th 800 (2022): Extreme emotional distress can negate the element of malice required for a murder conviction.
* State v. Williams, 554 N.W.2d 85 (Iowa 1996): Evidence of extreme emotional distress is admissible to support a defense of diminished capacity.
Judge: No Questions.
Defender: **V. Lack of Intent**

**Factual Rebuttal:**
* The prosecutor has failed to establish that Yumana had any malicious intent towards the victim.
* Witnesses will testify that Yumana was provoked by the victim's aggressive behavior.
* Yumana's actions were a direct response to the threat posed by the victim.

**Case Law Citation:**
* People v. Watson, 30 Cal.3d 290 (1981): Intent is an essential element of a crime and must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
* State v. Williams, 900 S.W.2d 129 (1995): Provocation can negate the element of intent in a criminal case.

**Conclusion:**
The prosecution has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish Yumana's guilt. Yumana acted in self-defense and lacked the malicious intent necessary to commit a crime. We respectfully request that the jury find Yumana not guilty of all charges.

Defender: **Point 1:** The prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence, which is inherently unreliable.

**Legal Support:**

* "Circumstantial evidence is not as reliable as direct evidence because it requires the jury to draw inferences from facts that are not directly observed." (State v. Jones, 620 N.W.2d 705, 709 (2001))
* "Circumstantial evidence must be strong enough to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence." (State v. Smith, 353 N.W.2d 228, 232 (1984))

**Application to the Case:**

* The prosecution's case relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, such as the defendant's proximity to the crime scene and the presence of his fingerprints on the murder weapon.
* However, this evidence is not conclusive and can be explained by innocent circumstances.
* For example, the defendant may have been near the crime scene because he was simply passing by, and his fingerprints may have been on the murder weapon because he had handled it previously without any criminal intent.

**Conclusion:**

* The prosecution's case is based on unreliable circumstantial evidence that does not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.
* Therefore, the defendant should be acquitted.
Defender: **Point 2: The prosecution's case lacks sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Yumana committed the alleged offense.**

**Legal Authority:**

* The burden of proof in a criminal case rests with the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (citing case law or statutory authority)

**Factual Analysis:**

* The prosecution's case relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, such as Yumana's proximity to the crime scene and his alleged association with the victim.
* However, circumstantial evidence alone is insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (citing case law or statutory authority)
* The prosecution has failed to present any direct evidence, such as eyewitnesses or physical evidence, that definitively links Yumana to the crime.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the lack of sufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the jury cannot be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Yumana committed the alleged offense. Therefore, the jury should find Yumana not guilty.
Judge: No Questions.
