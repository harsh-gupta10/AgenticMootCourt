Judge: Yes, you may begin.  Petitioner, please present your arguments.
Prosecutor: I rest my case. 
Judge: To the Petitioner:  Your arguments regarding Articles 21, 19(1)(g), 25, and 29 are noted. However, the amendments introduce Sections 9A and 9B, shifting the burden of proof to the accused.  Can you elaborate on how this burden shift, in itself, violates any specific fundamental right, and which case law supports your contention that such a shift is *per se* unconstitutional?  Furthermore,  how do you reconcile the potential impact on the livelihood of those involved in the meat trade with the State's interest in animal welfare, considering the Directive Principles of State Policy?

We have demonstrated that the burden shift in Sections 9A and 9B violates the fundamental right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 by contravening the presumption of innocence.  Furthermore, the complete ban on the meat trade, as implemented, constitutes an unreasonable restriction on fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g), 25, and 29.  The State has failed to demonstrate a compelling state interest that justifies such a sweeping and disproportionate measure, especially considering the lack of exploration of less restrictive alternatives.\n\nRegarding the reconciliation of livelihood with animal welfare, the State's approach is fundamentally flawed.  While animal welfare is a legitimate concern, it cannot be achieved at the expense of the fundamental rights of a large segment of the population.  The State must demonstrate a proportionate and balanced approach, exploring less restrictive means to achieve its objectives before resorting to a complete ban that devastates livelihoods and infringes upon fundamental rights.  The current amendments, in their totality, are unconstitutional and must be struck down.  The court should consider directing the State to explore and implement less restrictive measures that balance animal welfare with the protection of fundamental rights.", 'intermediate_steps': [(AgentAction(tool='search_bns_store', tool_input='burden of proof presumption of innocence Supreme Court India', log='Input: The Judge\'s questions regarding the burden shift, violation of fundamental rights, and reconciliation of livelihood with animal welfare.\n\nCase details: The Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act amendments, introducing Sections 9A and 9B, shifting the burden of proof to the accused.

Petitioners challenge this as violating Articles 21, 19(1)(g), 25, and 29.\n\nThought:The Judge\'s concerns center around the burden shift\'s impact on fundamental rights and the balance between animal welfare and the livelihood of those in the meat trade.  My response will address each concern separately, citing relevant case law where possible.\n\nARGUMENT: Violation of the Presumption of Innocence (Article 21)\n\nThe shift in burden of proof in Sections 9A and 9B directly contravenes the fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence, enshrined within Article 21\'s guarantee of personal liberty.  The accused is now required to prove their innocence, reversing the established legal principle that the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This violates the established jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, which consistently upholds the presumption of innocence as a cornerstone of a fair trial.  We need to examine precedents where the court has struck down laws that shifted the burden of proof onto the accused, thereby violating this fundamental right.\n\nARGUMENT: Unreasonable Restriction on Fundamental Rights (Articles 19(1)(g), 25, 29)\n\nThe amendments, by imposing a complete ban on the meat trade, unreasonably restrict the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) (right to practice any profession or carry on any occupation, trade or business), 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion), and 29 (protection of interests of minorities).  The State\'s interest in animal welfare, while legitimate, cannot justify such a sweeping restriction without demonstrating a compelling state interest and a proportionate response.  The complete ban disproportionately impacts the livelihoods of thousands, violating the principles of proportionality and reasonableness.\n\nARGUMENT: Lack of Proportionality and Inadequacy of State\'s Justification\n\nThe State\'s justification for the ban, based on animal welfare and Directive Principles of State Policy, is insufficient to justify the drastic measure of a complete ban and the shifting of the burden of proof.  The State has not demonstrated that less restrictive measures, such as stricter regulations or improved enforcement of existing laws, would be inadequate.  The complete ban, coupled with the burden shift, is a disproportionate response that infringes upon fundamental rights without sufficient justification.  The court must consider whether the State has explored and exhausted less restrictive alternatives before resorting to such a sweeping ban.\n\nThought: I need to find case law supporting the arguments above.\n\nAction: search_bns_store\n\nAction Input: "Supreme Court India burden of proof fundamental rights proportionality"'), Document(id='3ff91eb5-c57b-4f27-a2e0-c7944e2fd7bf', metadata={}, page_content='Kerala,AIR 1973, SC 1461.\n7.
