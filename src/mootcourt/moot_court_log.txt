The respondent's arguments will now begin.
Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: May it please Your Lordships, I appear on behalf of the Respondent, the State of Mahadpur, in the matter of PQR & Ors v. State of Mahadpur. With Your Lordships' permission, may I begin my submissions?
Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: Much obliged, Your Lordships. This petition challenges the constitutional validity of the amendments made to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, specifically Sections 5A, 5B, 5C, 9A, and 9B, which impose restrictions concerning the transportation, slaughter, import, and possession of the flesh of cows, bulls, and bullocks within the State of Mahadpur. The matter is before this Hon'ble Court under its writ jurisdiction as enshrined in Article 32 of the Constitution of India, invoked by the Petitioners alleging violations of their fundamental rights.

May I proceed to outline the issues for determination before this Hon'ble Court, Your Lordships?
Judge: Counsel, before you proceed to outline the specific issues, could you briefly reiterate which fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution you contend are violated by the impugned amendments?
Respondent: Your Lordships, to clarify, it is the Petitioners who contend that the impugned amendments violate certain fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. As per their petition, the rights they allege are infringed upon are primarily:
   Article 21, concerning the Right to Life and Personal Liberty, specifically relating to privacy and personal choice in matters of diet.
   Article 19(1)(g), concerning the Right to Practice any Profession, or to carry on any Occupation, Trade or Business, which they claim is hindered by the ban.
   Articles 25 and 29, concerning the Right to Freedom of Religion and the Protection of Interests of Minorities, respectively, which they argue are impacted by the restrictions.

The Respondent, the State of Mahadpur, firmly contends that the amendments do not violate any fundamental rights. We submit that the restrictions imposed are reasonable, fall within the permissible limits prescribed by the Constitution, particularly under Article 19(6), and are enacted in furtherance of the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48.

If Your Lordships permit, I shall now proceed to outline the issues for determination before this Hon'ble Court.
Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: Okay, Your Lordships. The primary issues for determination before this Hon'ble Court are as follows:

1.  Whether the impugned amendments to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, particularly the complete ban on possession and consumption of the flesh of cows, bulls, and bullocks, infringe upon the Petitioners' Right to Privacy and Personal Choice, thereby violating Article 21 of the Constitution.
2.  Whether the said amendments impose an unreasonable restriction on the Petitioners' Right to Freedom of Trade and Occupation under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, exceeding the permissible limits of reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6).
3.  Whether the impugned amendments interfere with the Petitioners' rights under Article 25 (Freedom of Religion) and Article 29 (Cultural Rights of Minorities).
4.  Whether the State legislature was competent to enact the impugned amendments, and whether the said amendments are justified and protected under the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, concerning the organisation of agriculture and animal husbandry.
5.  Whether Sections 9A and 9B of the amended Act, which place the burden of proof on the accused, are constitutionally valid and do not violate the principles of natural justice and Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

With Your Lordships' permission, I shall now proceed to present the arguments on behalf of the Respondent, addressing the first issue concerning Article 21.
Judge: `<None>`
Respondent: Okay, Your Lordships.

Regarding the first issue, concerning the alleged violation of Article 21, the Respondent submits that the impugned amendments do not infringe upon the Petitioners' Right to Privacy or Personal Choice.

While this Hon'ble Court has rightly interpreted Article 21 to encompass a Right to Privacy, including aspects of personal autonomy and choice, this right, like others, is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law for legitimate state interests. The Petitioners' claim that the ban on possession and consumption of beef violates their dietary choice under Article 21 is unsustainable.

The State of Mahadpur contends that the regulation of foodstuffs is a legitimate state function, often exercised for reasons of public health, social welfare, and economic considerations. In this instance, the prohibition on possession under Section 5C is intrinsically linked to the primary objective of the Act: the preservation of cows, bulls, and bullocks, which are vital for the state's agricultural economy and are accorded special protection in furtherance of the Directive Principles enshrined in Article 48 of the Constitution.

The ban on possession is necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the prohibition on slaughter within the state. Allowing possession would create a significant loophole, making it difficult, if not impossible, to enforce the ban on slaughter, as the origin of the possessed flesh would be hard to ascertain. Therefore, the restriction imposed is not arbitrary but is a necessary corollary to the primary legislative policy of animal preservation. It constitutes a reasonable restriction enacted in the public interest and for the larger good, directly related to the objectives outlined in Article 48.

The right to choose one's food cannot override the State's legitimate interest in regulating activities that directly impact the agricultural economy and animal welfare, especially when such regulation is aimed at giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy.

Unless Your Lordships have any questions on this issue, may I proceed to address the second issue concerning Article 19(1)(g)?
Judge: Counsel, you argue the ban on possession is a necessary corollary to the ban on slaughter within the state, primarily for preserving Mahadpur's cattle as per Article 48. How does this justification extend to prohibiting the possession of beef that has been legally slaughtered in and imported from another state where such slaughter is permissible? How does possessing such legally imported beef hinder the preservation of Mahadpur's cattle?
Respondent: Your Lordships, I shall address the query regarding the extension of the ban on possession to beef legally slaughtered outside Mahadpur and imported into the state.

It is submitted that the prohibition on possession of any beef within the state, irrespective of its origin, is a necessary measure to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the primary legislative object, which is the preservation of cattle specified under the Act within the State of Mahadpur, in line with Article 48.

The rationale is primarily grounded in the practical challenges of enforcement. If the possession of beef legally imported from other states were permitted, it would create an insurmountable difficulty for enforcement agencies to distinguish between legally imported beef and beef derived from cattle illegally slaughtered within Mahadpur. Once the flesh is possessed, its origin becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain definitively without complex and often impractical forensic examination for every instance.

Allowing possession of imported beef would, therefore, create a significant loophole, effectively rendering the ban on slaughter within Mahadpur unenforceable. Persons could easily claim that any beef found in their possession was legally imported, thereby masking illegal slaughter activities occurring within the state's borders. This would directly undermine the Act's core objective of preserving the state's own cattle population.

Thus, the ban on possession, even extending to legally imported beef, is not an arbitrary measure. It is an essential ancillary provision, a necessary corollary to the ban on slaughter, designed to prevent the circumvention of the law and ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the legislative scheme aimed at protecting Mahadpur's cattle resources as mandated by the Directive Principles under Article 48. It is a measure enacted to make the primary prohibition practically effective within the state's territory.
Judge: Counsel, you state that distinguishing legally imported beef from illegally slaughtered local beef is practically impossible, necessitating a complete ban on possession. Were any less restrictive measures, such as requiring documentation for imported beef or exploring technological tracing methods, considered by the State to address this enforcement challenge without imposing a total ban on possession?
Respondent: Your Lordships raise a pertinent point regarding the consideration of less restrictive measures. It is submitted that while alternatives like documentation for imported beef or technological tracing methods might exist in theory, the State legislature considered the practical impediments to their effective implementation in the context of enforcing the ban on slaughter within Mahadpur.

    Regarding documentation, the sheer volume of potential imports, the risk of forged or inaccurate documents, and the difficulty of verifying the origin at the point of possession by numerous individuals across the state would create significant enforcement challenges. It would require an extensive and potentially cost-prohibitive administrative machinery for verification, which could still be easily circumvented.

    As for technological tracing, while advancements exist, implementing a foolproof system to track meat from slaughter outside the state to possession within Mahadpur, applicable to every instance, presents considerable logistical, technological, and financial hurdles. Such systems are not yet universally available, standardized, or easily implementable at a scale that would guarantee the integrity of the slaughter ban within Mahadpur.

    The fundamental challenge remains the difficulty in distinguishing, reliably and efficiently, legally imported beef from beef originating from illegal slaughter within the state once it reaches the point of possession. Allowing possession, even with documentation or potential tracing, was considered by the legislature to create an unacceptable risk of the primary prohibition on slaughter being rendered ineffective. Therefore, the legislature, in its wisdom and considering the paramount objective of preserving the State's cattle population as per Article 48 and the practical realities of enforcement, deemed the comprehensive ban on possession a necessary measure to ensure the Act's objectives were not defeated through circumvention.

    Does this address Your Lordships' query? If Your Lordships permit, I shall now proceed to the arguments concerning Article 19(1)(g).
Judge: Counsel, you assert that the legislature considered alternatives like documentation and tracing but deemed them impractical or cost-prohibitive. On what specific evidence, studies, or reports did the legislature rely to reach this conclusion regarding the infeasibility of these less restrictive measures compared to a complete ban on possession?
Respondent: Your Lordships, the determination regarding the impracticality of measures like documentation and tracing stems from the legislative assessment of the ground realities of enforcement within the State of Mahadpur. While specific, detailed cost-benefit analysis reports or named empirical studies might not be explicitly appended to the legislative record readily available to counsel at this moment, the legislative process itself, including debates, committee deliberations [if applicable], and inputs received from administrative and enforcement agencies, inherently involves consideration of such factors.

The legislature considered the significant administrative burden, the potential for widespread fraud and forgery of documentation across numerous points of sale and possession, and the substantial costs associated with establishing and maintaining a reliable verification system or a foolproof technological tracing mechanism statewide. The sheer scale of the task, coupled with the difficulty of immediate, on-the-spot verification by enforcement officers, led the legislature to conclude that such alternatives would be easily circumvented and ultimately ineffective in preventing the commingling of legally imported beef with beef from illegally slaughtered local cattle.

Therefore, the legislature, in its considered judgment, based on the perceived administrative and enforcement challenges, the potential for abuse, and the paramount need to ensure the effectiveness of the primary ban on slaughter within the State to uphold the objectives of Article 48, concluded that a complete ban on possession was the most practical and necessary measure. It was deemed the only viable means to prevent the legislative scheme from being rendered nugatory.

Does this explanation address Your Lordships' concern regarding the basis for the legislature's conclusion?
Judge: Counsel, while accepting that the legislature considered these matters, you rely on the "legislative assessment" and "perceived challenges" to justify the conclusion that alternatives like documentation or tracing were impractical. Was this conclusion based on concrete evidence presented during deliberations demonstrating these alternatives would be ineffective or impossible to implement, or was it primarily an assessment based on anticipated administrative difficulties and potential for fraud, without specific data comparing these difficulties to the impact of a complete ban on fundamental rights?
