The respondent's arguments will now begin.
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, I am [Your Name], appearing on behalf of the Respondent, the State of Bramha, in the matter of Alert Indiva Vs. State of Bramha and Other. With Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's kind permission, I shall commence the submissions for the Respondent.
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship. This petition, filed by Alert Indiva under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of Indiva, challenges the State of Bramha's policy decision to construct a dam and the environmental clearance granted for the same. The Respondent, the State of Bramha, submits that the petition is misconceived and that the actions taken by the State are constitutionally valid, legally sound, and undertaken in the paramount public interest to address the severe water crisis affecting the State. The Respondent acknowledges the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble High Court to hear this matter under Articles 226 and 227.

    With Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's permission, I shall now proceed to the Statement of Issues as framed by this Hon'ble Court.
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : : Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship. The issues framed by this Hon'ble Court for adjudication are as follows:

1.  Whether the present petition has been filed in public interest and therefore maintainable as a Public Interest Litigation?
2.  Whether the Writ Petition filed under Art. 226 and Art. 227 of the Constitution of Indiva is Maintainable?
3.  Whether the High Court of BRAMHA can interfere in any policy decision taken by the State of BRAMHA?
4.  Whether the displacement of the agriculturists from the area where the proposed dam is to be constructed amounts to violation of Art. 21 of the Constitution of Indiva?
5.  Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted by the State is contrary to the provisions of Constitution of Indiva?
6.  Whether the decision taken by the State of BRAHMA to construct the dam deserves to be maintained or should be quashed and set aside?

With Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's permission, I shall now proceed to present the arguments on behalf of the Respondent, addressing these issues sequentially, starting with Issue No. 1 concerning the maintainability of the petition as a Public Interest Litigation.
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, addressing the first issue: "Whether the present petition has been filed in public interest and therefore maintainable as a Public Interest Litigation?"

The Respondent, the State of Bramha, acknowledges the well-established principles of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in Indiva's jurisprudence. PIL serves as a vital tool allowing access to justice for those unable to approach the courts directly and enables concerned citizens and organizations, such as the Petitioner 'Alert Indiva', to raise matters of significant public concern, including environmental protection and the rights of affected communities.

The Respondent recognizes that the issues raised – environmental impact and potential displacement – fall within the ambit of matters typically addressed through PIL. Alert Indiva, being an NGO dedicated to environmental causes, prima facie possesses the locus standi to bring such matters before this Hon'ble Court in the public interest.

However, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the maintainability of this petition as a PIL does not, in itself, substantiate the claims made therein or invalidate the actions taken by the State. While the procedural door of PIL is open, the substantive merits of the case must still be rigorously examined. The Respondent firmly contends that the decision to construct the dam, undertaken after due consideration and procedural compliance, is a necessary measure driven by the overwhelming public interest in alleviating the severe water crisis plaguing the State of Bramha. This larger public interest, we submit, must be weighed against the concerns raised by the Petitioner.

Therefore, while the Respondent concedes that the petition can be procedurally categorized as a PIL, we maintain that the substantive claims lack merit and the State's actions are legally and constitutionally sound, undertaken for the greater public good.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, I seek permission to proceed to address Issue No. 2: "Whether the Writ Petition filed under Art. 226 and Art. 227 of the Constitution of Indiva is Maintainable?"
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship.

Proceeding to the second issue: "Whether the Writ Petition filed under Art. 226 and Art. 227 of the Constitution of Indiva is Maintainable?"

Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent acknowledges the wide powers vested in this Hon'ble High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of Indiva. This Article empowers the High Court to issue writs, directions, or orders for the enforcement of fundamental rights, as enumerated in Part III of the Constitution, and 'for any other purpose'. The Petitioners herein invoke this jurisdiction alleging a violation of Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty) and challenging the legality of the Environmental Clearance Certificate granted for the dam construction.

Furthermore, Article 227 grants this Hon'ble Court the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. While the primary challenge here concerns executive action and policy, the Petitioners have invoked this Article as well.

The Respondent submits that, technically, a petition challenging state action, alleging infringement of fundamental rights and questioning the legality of administrative decisions like the grant of an environmental clearance, can be brought before this Hon'ble Court under Article 226. The Court possesses the jurisdiction to examine whether the State's actions are arbitrary, unreasonable, contrary to law, or violative of fundamental rights.

However, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the mere existence of jurisdiction does not automatically render the petition substantively maintainable in the sense that it warrants interference by this Court. The maintainability under Article 226 is predicated on the Petitioner demonstrating a prima facie case of illegality, irrationality, procedural impropriety, or violation of fundamental rights. The Respondent contends that the Petitioners have failed to establish such grounds. The decision to construct the dam is a considered policy decision taken in the larger public interest to combat a severe water crisis, and the environmental clearance was granted following due process.

Therefore, while the Respondent concedes that this Hon'ble Court has the jurisdiction under Article 226 to entertain this petition, we strongly submit that the petition lacks the substantive merit required to warrant judicial interference in the State's legitimate exercise of its executive and statutory functions. The grounds raised, we contend, are insufficient to maintain the challenge against the State's actions.

With Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's permission, I shall now proceed to address Issue No. 3: "Whether the High Court of BRAMHA can interfere in any policy decision taken by the State of BRAMHA?"
Judge: : Counsel, you assert that the environmental clearance was granted following 'due process'. Could you elaborate on the specific procedures undertaken by the Ministry of Environment and Forest to satisfy this requirement, particularly regarding the assessment of environmental impact and the consideration of the villagers' concerns about displacement and livelihood, prior to granting the clearance?
Respondent: :

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship. Addressing Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's specific query regarding the 'due process' followed by the Ministry of Environment and Forest prior to granting the environmental clearance:

The Respondent submits that the environmental clearance for the dam project was granted strictly in accordance with the established procedures mandated under the environmental laws of Indiva, which ensure a thorough assessment and consideration of all relevant factors. While the specific details of the file are not before this Hon'ble Court at this precise moment, the standard 'due process' for such a project invariably involves the following key stages:

1.  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): The project proponent, Reliable Industries Limited, would have been required to conduct a comprehensive EIA study. This study meticulously examines the potential environmental consequences of the proposed dam, including impacts on hydrology, ecology, land use, and importantly, the socio-economic effects on local populations. This assessment directly addresses the potential for submergence of agricultural fields and the impact on livelihoods.
2.  Public Consultation: A crucial component of this due process is mandatory public consultation. This typically involves public hearings held in the vicinity of the proposed project site, providing a platform for affected persons, including the villagers whose displacement and livelihood are concerns, to voice their objections, apprehensions, and suggestions. Written representations are also solicited and considered. This ensures that the concerns Your Lordship/Your Ladyship has highlighted regarding displacement and livelihood are formally recorded and brought before the decision-making authorities.
3.  Expert Appraisal: The EIA report, along with the proceedings and outcomes of the public consultation, is then subjected to scrutiny by a multi-disciplinary Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC). This committee comprises experts from various fields relevant to environmental and social impacts. They evaluate the adequacy of the EIA, the severity of the predicted impacts, the feasibility of proposed mitigation measures, and the substance of the public concerns raised.
4.  Ministry's Decision: The Ministry of Environment and Forest makes the final decision based on the recommendations of the EAC, the EIA report, and the public consultation feedback. This decision involves balancing the anticipated environmental and social costs (including displacement and loss of livelihood) against the project's stated benefits – in this case, addressing the acute water scarcity in the State of Bramha, which constitutes a significant 'larger public interest'. The clearance, when granted, typically includes mandatory conditions for mitigation, resettlement, and rehabilitation (R&R) to address the adverse impacts identified, including those affecting the villagers.

Therefore, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the assertion that clearance was granted following 'due process' refers to this established, multi-stage procedure designed specifically to assess environmental impacts and integrate public concerns, including those related to displacement and livelihood, into the final decision-making framework. The State contends that these procedures were duly followed before the clearance was granted.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, having addressed your query, may I seek permission to return to the structured arguments, specifically addressing Issue No. 3 concerning the scope of judicial review over policy decisions? Or would Your Lordship/Your Ladyship prefer that I elaborate further on Issue No. 5 regarding the Environmental Clearance Certificate at this juncture?
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship.

Proceeding now to the third issue: "Whether the High Court of BRAMHA can interfere in any policy decision taken by the State of BRAMHA?"

Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent submits that while this Hon'ble Court possesses the power of judicial review under Article 226, the scope of interference in matters of governmental policy is circumscribed. The decision to construct dams to combat the severe water scarcity and drought-like conditions in the State of Bramha is fundamentally a policy decision, arrived at after considering the needs of the populace for drinking water, agriculture, and industry, as well as the ecological necessity of recouping groundwater levels.

It is a settled principle of law that courts do not substitute their judgment for that of the executive in policy matters. The executive, being accountable to the legislature and the people, is vested with the primary responsibility of formulating policies based on expert advice, resource availability, and the overall needs of the state. Judicial review in such matters is generally confined to examining the legality, rationality, and procedural propriety of the decision-making process, rather than the wisdom or efficacy of the policy itself.

Interference is warranted only if the policy decision is demonstrably arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, contrary to statutory provisions, or violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. In the present case, the policy to construct dams is a rational response to an undeniable crisis – the acute scarcity of water. It is aimed at achieving the larger public good and falls squarely within the executive domain of resource management and infrastructure development. The State has considered the competing interests and determined that the construction of the dam is necessary in the public interest.

The Petitioners are essentially asking this Hon'ble Court to sit in judgment over the State's assessment of the best way to manage its water resources. This, the Respondent submits, would transgress the established boundaries of judicial review. Unless the Petitioners can establish manifest arbitrariness or illegality in the decision-making process, the policy decision of the State of Bramha ought not to be interfered with.

(Self-correction: Initially, I might have just stated the principle. Adding the connection back to the specific facts - the water crisis and the purpose of the dam - strengthens the argument)

Therefore, the Respondent humbly submits that this Hon'ble Court should exercise restraint and refrain from interfering in the policy decision taken by the State of Bramha, as it is neither arbitrary nor illegal, but a necessary measure taken in the public interest.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, I seek permission to proceed to address Issue No. 4: "Whether the displacement of the agriculturists from the area where the proposed dam is to be constructed amounts to violation of Art. 21 of the Constitution of Indiva?"
Judge: : Counsel, you argue for judicial restraint unless the policy is 'manifestly arbitrary' or violates fundamental rights. At what point could the scale or severity of the negative impact, such as the displacement of entire communities and the complete loss of their agricultural livelihood as alleged here, render an otherwise rational policy decision judicially reviewable on grounds of arbitrariness or disproportionality under Article 14 or Article 21?
Respondent: : Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, I acknowledge the gravity of the concern raised regarding the point at which the scale and severity of impact might render a policy decision judicially reviewable, even if its underlying objective appears rational.

The Respondent maintains the position of judicial restraint in policy matters. However, this restraint is not absolute. The Hon'ble Courts have consistently held that the implementation and consequences of a policy are indeed subject to judicial scrutiny, particularly when fundamental rights are implicated.

Addressing Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's specific points:

1.  Article 14 (Arbitrariness and Disproportionality): While the objective of alleviating water scarcity is rational, the means employed must also satisfy the test of reasonableness under Article 14. If the negative impact – such as the displacement of entire communities and the complete loss of their agricultural livelihood – is grossly disproportionate to the public good sought to be achieved, it could potentially render the action arbitrary. The principle of proportionality requires a balancing act. The scale of displacement alleged here necessitates that the State demonstrate not only the overriding public purpose but also that it has taken all necessary steps to mitigate the hardship. This includes ensuring that the resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) measures are fair, just, and adequate to restore the livelihoods of the affected persons as far as reasonably possible. A failure to provide such adequate measures, or an R&R package that is merely illusory, could potentially invite judicial intervention on grounds of disproportionality amounting to arbitrariness under Article 14.

2.  Article 21 (Right to Life and Livelihood): The Right to Livelihood has been recognized as an integral part of the Right to Life under Article 21. Deprivation of livelihood must occur according to a 'procedure established by law' which is fair, just, and reasonable. Large-scale displacement undoubtedly impacts this right severely. However, the jurisprudence of this Hon'ble Court and the Supreme Court, notably in cases like Narmada Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India (2000), recognizes that displacement necessitated by development projects undertaken for a significant public purpose is permissible, provided it is accompanied by a comprehensive and effectively implemented R&R plan. The threshold for judicial intervention under Article 21 in such cases often lies in the adequacy and fairness of these R&R measures. If the State fails to provide meaningful rehabilitation, thereby rendering the displaced persons destitute and without alternative livelihoods, it could amount to a violation of Article 21.

Therefore, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the point at which judicial review is triggered is not merely by the existence of displacement, but by a potential failure of the State to act fairly, proportionately, and reasonably in addressing the consequences of that displacement. The scale of the impact necessitates a correspondingly robust and humane response from the State.

The Respondent submits that the State of Bramha is acutely conscious of its constitutional obligations. The decision to proceed with the dam was taken after considering these impacts, and the State is committed to implementing a comprehensive R&R package that adheres to national standards and ensures that the affected villagers are not deprived of their right to livelihood in an arbitrary manner. We contend that the measures planned are adequate and proportionate, thus keeping the State's actions within the bounds of Articles 14 and 21.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, having addressed your query, may I now seek permission to proceed to address Issue No. 4: "Whether the displacement of the agriculturists from the area where the proposed dam is to be constructed amounts to violation of Art. 21 of the Constitution of Indiva?"
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: 
Judge: : Counsel, you stated the State is committed to implementing a comprehensive Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) package adhering to national standards. Could you please specify which particular national standards, legislation, or policy guidelines the State is relying upon for formulating and implementing this R&R package for the affected villagers?
Respondent: : Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship.

Proceeding now to the fourth issue: "Whether the displacement of the agriculturists from the area where the proposed dam is to be constructed amounts to violation of Art. 21 of the Constitution of Indiva?"

Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent acknowledges that the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Constitution of Indiva has been interpreted expansively by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to include the Right to Livelihood. The displacement of the agriculturists and the potential submergence or waterlogging of their lands undeniably impacts their primary source of livelihood.

However, the Respondent submits that this impact does not automatically constitute a violation of Article 21. The fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution are not absolute and can be subject to reasonable restrictions, particularly when necessitated by the larger public interest. The deprivation of property or livelihood, if any, must be in accordance with a 'procedure established by law' which is fair, just, and reasonable, as established in Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India.

In the present case, the construction of the dam is a critical infrastructure project undertaken by the State of Bramha to combat an acute water scarcity crisis affecting a vast population. This constitutes a compelling public purpose. The displacement of villagers, while regrettable, is an unavoidable consequence of pursuing this vital objective for the common good.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in landmark cases such as Narmada Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India (2000), has dealt extensively with the issue of displacement due to large dam projects. The Court recognized that while displacement impacts the right to livelihood, it is permissible under Article 21 provided it is done for a public purpose and is accompanied by adequate and fair Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) measures for the Project Affected Persons (PAPs). The emphasis is on ensuring that the displaced persons are not left without means of livelihood and are properly resettled.

The State of Bramha is fully cognizant of its constitutional and humanitarian obligations towards the affected villagers. The State assures this Hon'ble Court that a comprehensive R&R package, formulated in accordance with established national norms and policies, will be implemented to ensure that the displaced agriculturists are provided with alternative land, financial compensation, and necessary support to re-establish their livelihoods. This package aims to mitigate the hardship caused by displacement and ensure that the affected persons share in the benefits of the project.

Therefore, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent contends that since the displacement is necessitated by a significant public purpose and is coupled with a commitment to provide fair and just resettlement and rehabilitation, the action does not amount to a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of Indiva.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, I seek permission to proceed to address Issue No. 5: "Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted by the State is contrary to the provisions of Constitution of Indiva?"
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship.

Addressing Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's query regarding the specific national standards, legislation, or policy guidelines underpinning the Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) package for the affected villagers:

The State of Bramha, in formulating and implementing the R&R package, is primarily guided by and adheres to the comprehensive framework established by "The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013" (LARR Act, 2013). This central legislation mandates detailed procedures and entitlements for individuals and families affected by land acquisition for public purposes, such as the construction of this dam.

Specifically, the LARR Act, 2013, lays down minimum standards concerning:
1.  Compensation: Ensuring fair market value for the acquired land and assets.
2.  Rehabilitation and Resettlement Entitlements: This includes provisions such as, where applicable, land for land, housing units in resettlement areas, transitional allowances, transportation costs, and other measures aimed at restoring the livelihoods of the affected families, particularly agriculturists and agricultural labourers.
3.  Infrastructure in Resettlement Areas: Mandating the provision of essential amenities and infrastructure in the areas where affected families are resettled.
4.  Special Provisions: Addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups, including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, if any are affected.
5.  Procedural Safeguards: Including requirements for Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and consultation with affected communities through Gram Sabhas or equivalent bodies.

The State of Bramha's commitment is to ensure that the R&R package meets, and where feasible exceeds, the requirements stipulated under the LARR Act, 2013, and any relevant State-level rules or policies framed in consonance with this Act, thereby ensuring a just and fair process for the displaced agriculturists.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, having clarified the basis for the R&R package, I seek permission to proceed to address Issue No. 5: "Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted by the State is contrary to the provisions of Constitution of Indiva?"
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship.

Proceeding now to the fifth issue: "Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted by the State is contrary to the provisions of Constitution of Indiva?"

Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent submits that the Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) granted for the construction of the dam is not contrary to the provisions of the Constitution of Indiva. On the contrary, the process of granting the ECC is designed to uphold the constitutional mandate of balancing environmental protection with sustainable development.

1.  Procedural Compliance: As previously submitted, the ECC was granted after adhering to the rigorous procedures established under the environmental laws of Indiva, primarily the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the relevant Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notifications thereunder. This process, involving mandatory EIA studies, public consultations, and expert appraisal, ensures a systematic evaluation of potential environmental impacts and the consideration of mitigation measures. This structured process itself embodies the principle of reasonableness required under the Constitution.

2.  Constitutional Balance: The Constitution of Indiva, while emphasizing the protection and improvement of the environment under Article 48A (Directive Principles) and Article 51A(g) (Fundamental Duties), also mandates the State to promote the welfare of the people (Article 38) and undertake development activities for the larger public good. The grant of environmental clearance, particularly for a project aimed at alleviating severe water scarcity, represents a considered decision by the competent authority to balance these constitutional imperatives – the need for environmental protection and the necessity of development for public welfare.

3.  Decision by Competent Authority: The clearance was granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, the designated competent authority, based on expert recommendations and after considering the feedback received during public consultations. This decision reflects an administrative determination that the project's benefits, particularly in addressing the critical water needs of the State of Bramha, outweigh the potential environmental impacts, provided that the stipulated mitigation measures are implemented.

4.  No Violation of Specific Provisions: The Petitioners have not demonstrated how the grant of the ECC, following the prescribed legal and procedural framework, violates any specific provision of the Constitution. The process ensures that environmental concerns, implicitly linked to the Right to Life under Article 21 (which includes the right to a healthy environment), are explicitly addressed and weighed against the public interest.

Therefore, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent contends that the Environmental Clearance Certificate, having been granted after due process and reflecting a necessary balance between environmental considerations and the compelling public interest in securing water resources, is fully in consonance with the letter and spirit of the Constitution of Indiva.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, I seek permission to proceed to the final issue, Issue No. 6: "Whether the decision taken by the State of BRAHMA to construct the dam deserves to be maintained or should be quashed and set aside?"
Judge: : Counsel, you argue the ECC process balances environmental protection with development needs and addresses the right to a healthy environment under Article 21. Could you elaborate on how the specific findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment regarding ecological damage, and the concerns raised during public consultations about environmental degradation, were substantively weighed against the public interest of water security when the competent authority decided to grant the clearance? How was the 'right to a healthy environment' specifically factored into this balancing exercise beyond mere procedural compliance?
Respondent: :

Much obliged, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship.

Proceeding now to the sixth and final issue: "Whether the decision taken by the State of BRAHMA to construct the dam deserves to be maintained or should be quashed and set aside?"

Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the Respondent, the State of Bramha, submits with utmost respect that the decision to construct the dam is a necessary, lawful, and constitutionally sound measure undertaken in the paramount public interest and therefore, deserves to be maintained by this Hon'ble Court.

1.  Overriding Public Interest: The State is facing an acute water crisis, bordering on drought conditions. The construction of the dam is a critical policy decision aimed at ensuring water security for drinking, agriculture, and industry, and replenishing groundwater levels – objectives vital for the survival and well-being of the populace. This constitutes a compelling public purpose.
2.  Legality and Procedural Compliance: As submitted earlier, the decision-making process, including the grant of the Environmental Clearance Certificate, adhered to the established legal and procedural framework under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and associated EIA notifications. This involved impact assessments, public consultations, and expert appraisal, ensuring environmental concerns were duly considered.
3.  Constitutional Validity:
       The policy decision falls within the executive domain and is not arbitrary, mala fide, or irrational, thus warranting judicial restraint (Issue 3).
       The impact on the livelihood of agriculturists (Issue 4), while acknowledged, does not violate Article 21 as it is necessitated by public purpose and is being addressed through a comprehensive Resettlement and Rehabilitation package formulated under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
       The Environmental Clearance Certificate (Issue 5) reflects a considered balance between environmental protection and the urgent need for development, consistent with constitutional principles.
4.  Maintainability of Petition: While the petition is maintainable procedurally as a PIL under Article 226 (Issues 1 & 2), the Petitioners have failed to establish substantive grounds demonstrating any illegality, irrationality, or constitutional infirmity in the State's actions that would warrant judicial interference.

Therefore, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, considering the overwhelming public interest in alleviating the severe water crisis, the adherence to due process, the commitment to fair resettlement and rehabilitation, and the constitutional validity of the State's actions, the Respondent humbly submits that the decision to construct the dam is justified and must be maintained. Quashing the decision would have severe adverse consequences for the people of Bramha who are dependent on this project for their basic water needs.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, having addressed all the issues framed by this Hon'ble Court, I seek permission to proceed to the Conclusion and Final Prayer.
Judge: : `<None>`
Respondent: : May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship. Addressing Your Lordship's/Your Ladyship's pertinent query regarding the substantive weighing of environmental impacts and the right to a healthy environment during the Environmental Clearance (EC) process:

The Respondent submits that the balancing exercise undertaken by the competent authority, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, guided by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), goes beyond mere procedural checklist compliance. It involves a substantive evaluation where the 'right to a healthy environment', implicitly part of Article 21, is a central consideration.

1.  Weighing EIA Findings and Public Concerns: The EIA report quantifies the anticipated ecological damage (e.g., extent of forest submergence, impact on biodiversity, hydrological changes). Concerns raised during public consultations, particularly regarding environmental degradation and loss of livelihood, are documented and placed before the EAC and the Ministry. These negative impacts are explicitly acknowledged and form one side of the scale.
2.  Assessing Mitigation and Alternatives: The EAC critically examines the feasibility and effectiveness of the mitigation measures proposed by the project proponent (Reliable Industries Limited) to counteract the identified environmental damage. This includes plans for compensatory afforestation, catchment area treatment, wildlife conservation (if applicable), and, crucially, the Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) plan for displaced persons. The viability of less damaging alternatives, if any were suggested or are apparent, is also considered.
3.  Factoring the Right to a Healthy Environment (Art. 21): This right informs the entire process. It requires the authority to ensure that the environmental degradation is not irreversible or catastrophic and that the measures proposed to mitigate harm are robust and likely to succeed. The decision to grant clearance implies a finding by the authority that:
       The project's objective – alleviating severe water scarcity – serves a fundamental aspect of the Right to Life (Article 21) for a vast population, providing a compelling public interest justification.
       The anticipated environmental damage, though significant, can be managed, mitigated, and compensated for to an acceptable degree through the stringent conditions imposed in the EC. These conditions are legally binding and enforceable.
       The R&R plan, formulated as per the LARR Act, 2013, aims to address the socio-economic impact, ensuring that the affected population's right to livelihood (also under Article 21) is protected through adequate compensation and rehabilitation measures.
4.  The Balancing Decision: The final decision by the Ministry involves weighing the quantified environmental and social costs (including the impact on the right to a healthy environment and livelihood) against the quantified and qualitative benefits of ensuring water security for the State. The grant of clearance signifies the authority's considered judgment, based on expert advice and public feedback, that the project's benefits, coupled with the mandated mitigation and rehabilitation measures, outweigh the environmental costs in the specific context of the acute water crisis faced by Bramha. It is a determination that the project, with safeguards, aligns with the principles of sustainable development.

Therefore, Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, the substantive concerns regarding ecological damage and the right to a healthy environment were integral to the decision-making process, not merely procedural hurdles. The clearance reflects a complex, context-specific balancing act performed by the expert statutory authorities entrusted with this responsibility.

May it please Your Lordship/Your Ladyship, having addressed your query regarding the substantive considerations in the environmental clearance process, and having previously presented arguments on Issue No. 6, I seek permission to proceed to the Conclusion and Final Prayer for the Respondent.
