Examples:

Input: What is the difference between Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution?
Thought: Article 14 deals with the right to equality, meaning everyone is equal before the law. Article 21 pertains to the protection of life and personal liberty. While Article 14 ensures non-discrimination, Article 21 ensures that the state cannot deprive a person of life or liberty without due process.
Final Answer: Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, while Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.

Input: What is the significance of the Kesavananda Bharati case?
Thought: The Kesavananda Bharati case was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of India in 1973. The case dealt with the extent of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution. The Court ruled that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution, but it could not alter its "basic structure". This doctrine ensures that essential features like democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights are preserved.
Final Answer: The Kesavananda Bharati case established the Basic Structure Doctrine, protecting core constitutional values from being amended by Parliament.

Input: Can a person be tried twice for the same offence in India?
Thought: This refers to the concept of double jeopardy. Article 20(2) of the Indian Constitution provides protection against double jeopardy, which means a person cannot be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. However, this applies only after a person has been prosecuted and punished. It does not apply to departmental proceedings or if the earlier prosecution did not result in punishment.
Final Answer: No, under Article 20(2), a person cannot be tried and punished twice for the same offence, but certain conditions apply.

Input: Is live-in relationship legal in India?
Thought: While not explicitly mentioned in law, the Supreme Court and various High Courts have held that live-in relationships are not illegal. If two consenting adults choose to live together, it is not a crime. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 also recognizes live-in relationships under certain conditions for providing legal remedies.
Final Answer: Yes, live-in relationships are legal in India, especially between consenting adults, and are protected under the law in certain contexts.
