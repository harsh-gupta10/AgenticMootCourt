    "The code extracts case data from a DOCX file by combining style analysis and text pattern recognition. It uses styles to identify \"Part\" and \"Topic\" headings, then extracts key-value pairs (like \"Name of the case\") using a combination of line-based extraction and bold text analysis with regex matching. Data is merged from different extraction methods and refined to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n",

But where the legislation falls in part within the area allotted to it and in part outside it, it is undoubtedly void as to the latter; but does it on account become necessarily void in its entirety? The answer to this question must depend on whether what is valid could be separated from what is invalid, and that is a question which has to be decided by court on a consideration of the provision of the act.\\u201d Further, based on the said judgement, the Supreme Court in Motor General Traders Case 1984, laid down following provisions as regard to the doctrine of severability: The intention of the legislature is the determining factor in determining whether the valid parts of the statute are separable from the invalid parts. The test is whether the legislature would have enacted the valid parts had it known the rest of the parts are invalid. If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably mixed up that they cannot be separated from one another, invalidity of a part must result in the invalidity of the act in its entirety. On the other hand, if there are some distinct and separate part after removing what is invalid, what survives can stand independently and is workable, the portion of which remains is in itself a complete code independent of the rest, then it will be upheld notwithstanding that the rest had become unenforceable. Even when the valid provisions are distinct and separate from the invalid provisions, but if they form part of a single statue which is intended to operate as a whole, then invalidity of a part will result in the failure of the whole. Likewise, though the valid and invalid parts of the statute are independent and may not form part of the scheme, but what is left after omitting the invalid person is so thin and truncated as to be in substance different from what it was when it emerged out of the legislature, then also it will be rejected in its entirety. If after the invalid part is expunged from the statute, what remains cannot be enforced without making alteration and modifications therein, then the whole of it must be struck down as void. The severability of the valid and invalid provisions of a statute does not depend on whether the provisions are in the same section or different sections; it is not the form, but the substance of the matter that is material, and that has to be ascertained on the examination of act as a whole. ___________________________________________________\",\n",

However, reservation of posts and appointments must be within reasonable limits, which is the maximum of 50%. The same limit applies to Article 15 (3). Reservation to a backward class is not a constitutional mandate, but a prerogative of the state. The provisions for Article 330 (1) (b) and (c) shows that the Constitution has treated Scheduled Tribes in the autonomous district of Assam as a separate category distinct from all other scheduled tribes. This clearly indicates that when the Constitution makers wanted to make a sub-classification of scheduled Tribes, they have themselves made it in the text of the Constitution itself and have not empowered any legislature or government to make such a sub-classification. It was also observed that Article 341 indicates that there can be only one list of Schedule Caste in regard to a state and that list should include all specified castes, races or tribes or part or groups notified in that presidential list. In the entire Constitution whenever reference has been made to \\u201cSchedule Castes\\u201d it refers only to the list prepared by President under Article 341 and there is no reference to any sub-classification or division in the state list except, maybe, for the limited purpose of Article 330.

The Constitution intended that all the castes included in the schedule under Article 341 would be deemed to be one class of persons.\",\n",

      "        \"Fact of the Case\": \"After the enactment of First Constitutional Amendment 1951, Balaji was the first case which came up before Supreme Court. And order of the Mysore Government issued under Article 15 (4) reserve seats for admission to the state medical and engineering colleges for backward class and more backward classes. This was in addition to the reservation of seats for the Schedule Castes (15%) and for the Scheduled Tribe (3%). Backward and more backward classes were designated on the basis of \\u2018caste\\u2019 and \\u2018communities\\u2019. The first facet in the Mysore order was that it was based solely on caste without regard to other relevant factors and this was not permissible under Article 15 (4). Though caste in relation to Hindu could be a relevant factor to consider in determining the social backwardness of a class of citizens, it must not be made the sole and dominant test in that behalf. Christians, Jains and Muslims do not believe in the caste system and, therefore, the test of the caste could not be applied to them. In as much as identification of all backward classes under the impugned order had been made solely on the basis of caste, the order was bad. Secondly, the test adopted by the state to measure educational backwardness was the basis of the average of student population in the last three highest school classes of all higher schools in the state in relation to thousands citizen of that community. This average for the whole state was 6.9 per thousand. The court stated that for women the test applied was rational and permissible to judge educational backwardness, it was not validly applied. Only community falling below the state average could properly be regarded as backward, but not a community which came near the average. Thirdly, the court declared that Article 15 (4) does not envisage classification between backward and more backward classes as was made by the Mysore order. Article 15 (4) authorizes a special provision being made for backward classes and not for such classes as were less advanced in the most Advanced classes in the state. By dropping the techniques of classifying communities into backward and more backward classes, 90% of the total population had been treated as backward. The order, in effect, sought to divide the state population into the most advanced and rest, but put the later into two categories - backward and more backward- and the classification of two categories is not envisaged by Article 15 (4). \\u201cThe interests of weaker Sections of society which are a first charge on the state and the Centre have to be adjusted with interest of community as a whole. The adjustment of these computing claims is undoubtedly difficult matter, but if under the guise of making a special provision, state reserves practically all the seats available in the college, that clearly would be subverting the object of Article 15 (4).\\u201d The state had \\u201cto approach its task objectively and in a rational manner\\u201d. The court further drew distinction between caste and class. An attempt at finding a new basis for asserting social and educational backwardness in a place of caste is reflected in the Balaji decision. Further, the court also ruled that reservation under Article 15 (4) should be reasonable. It should not be such as to defeat or nullify the main rule of equality instrument in Article 15 (1). While it would not be possible to predicate, it was observed that the permissible percentage of reservation ought to be less than 50%, \\u201chow much less than 50% would depend upon the relevant prevailing circumstances in each case\\u201d. Also, a provision under Article 15 (4) need not be in the form of law, it could as well be made by an executive order. ___________________________________________________\",\n",

      "        \"Ratio\": \"The Supreme Court after referring to various of its previous decisions under Article 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India and also taking notes from the decision of Supreme Court on racial discrimination, made following observations: The nature contemplated by Article 16 (4) can be provided not only by Parliament or legislature but also by executive to administrative instruction in respect of central and state services and by the local bodies and other authority as contemplated by Article 12, in respect of their services. The provision made by executive order under Article 16 (4) becomes effective and enforceable by itself without being elected into law by the legislature. The court has reiterated the view, expressed by it in Thomas case, that Article 16 (1) permits classification for attainment of equality of opportunity as sought by Article 16 (1) itself. Article 16 (1) is a facet of Article 14. Article 14 permits reasonable classification so does Article 16 (1). A classification may involve reservation of seats or vacancies, as the case maybe. In other words, under Article 16 (1), appointments and/or post can be reserved in favour of a class. Further, Article 16 (4) is not an exception to Article 16 (1), but only instance of classification implicit and permitted by Article 16 (1). Even without Article 16 (4), the state could have classified backward class of citizens in a separate category for special treatment in the nature of reservation of post and appointments in government services. Article 16 (4) merely puts the matter beyond any shadow of doubt in specific terms. Article 16 (4) permits reservation in favour of any \\u201cbackward classes of citizens\\u201d. Backward classes having been classified by the Constitution itself as a class deserving special treatment and the Constitution having itself specified the nature of special treatment, it should be presumed that no further classification or special treatment is permissible in favour of apart from or outside Article 16 (4). Even under Article 16 (1), reservation cannot be made on the basis of economic criterion alone. What is the meaning of expression backward class of citizens used in Article 16 (4)? What does the expression signify and how should such class be identified? The assent of Article 16 (4) is on social backwardness. From a review of the previous case law in the area, the court has concluded that the judicial opinion emphasise the integral connection between caste, occupation, poverty and social backwardness. Social, educational and economic backwardness closely intertwined in the Indian context. As regards identification or backward classes, caste may be used as a criterion because caste often is a social class in India. But caste cannot be the sole criterion for reservation. Reservation is not being made under Article 16 (4) in favour of a caste but a backward class. Once a caste satisfy the criterion of backwardness, it becomes a backward class for purpose of Article 16 (4). Besides caste there may be other communities, groups, classes and denomination which may qualify as backward class of citizens. Backwardness under Article 16 (4) need not be social as well as educational as in the case under Article 15 (4). The court has left the task of actually identifying backward classes to the commission to be appointed by government, this body would evolve a proper and relevant criteria and test the several groups, caste, classes and section of people against that criteria. A very important recommendation made by the court is that the \\u201ccreamy layer\\u201d, the socially advanced member of a backward class, should be excluded from the benefit of reservation. Such exclusion would benefit the truly backward people and thus, more appropriately serve the purpose of Article 16 (4). But the real difficulty is how and where to draw the line? For, while drawing the line, it should be ensured that it does not result in taking away with one hand what is given by other. Not only pseudo-class be a backward class for merit in reservation, it should also be in adequately presented in the services under the state. This matter lies within subjective satisfaction of state under Article 16(4). The total reservation cannot exceed 50% in any one year. Further, if a member belonging to, say, Scheduled Caste get selected in open competition on the basis of his own merit, he will not be counted against the quota reserved for schedule caste, he will be treated as open competition candidates. The court has divided the total reservation of 50% into vertical and horizontal reservation. The reservation in favour of Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes under Article 16 (4) may be called vertical reservation where is the service in favor of physically handicapped under Article 16 (1) can be referred to as horizontal reservation. Horizontal reservation cut across the vertical reservation and is called interlocking reservation. While 50% shall be the rule, it is necessary not to put out of consideration certain extraordinary situations inherit in the great diversity of this country and the people. It might happen that in far-flung and remote areas the population inhabiting those areas might, on account of their being out of the mainstream of national life and in view of condition peculiar to and characteristical to them, need to be treated in a different way, some relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative. In doing so, extreme caution is to be exercised and special case made out. A year is to be taken as a unit for the purpose of applying the 50% rule. A significant point made by the court is not to apply the rule of reservation to promotion. For the reserved category in-service, minimum standard can be prescribed. For certain services and certain posts, it may not be advisable to apply the rule of reservation. It is open to the government to notify which class among the several designated OBC are more backward, are appropriate of reserved job vacancies or posts among backward and more backward. The court has rejected the reservation or 10% post in favour of other economically backward section of people who are not covered by any existing scheme of reservation. The court has directed that there ought to be established a permanent body- Commission or tribunal, both at the Centre and in the state, which can look into complaints of wrong inclusion or wrong non-inclusion of groups, classes and sections in the list of OBCs. There should be a periodic revision of list of OBCs such as to exclude those who have ceased to be backward or to include new classes.\",\n",

There must be a direct and proximity access of a reasonable connection between restriction imposed and object sought to be achieved. No abstract or fixed principle can be laid down which may have universal application in all cases. Such consideration on the question of qualify of reasonableness, therefore, is expected to vary from cases to cases. To protect constitutional provision, the court should be alive to the felt needs of society and complex issues facing the people which the legislature intends to solve through effective legislation. In appreciating such problems and felt need of society judicial approach must necessarily be dynamic, pragmatic and elastic. It is imperative that for consideration of reasonableness of restriction imposed by a statute, the court should examine whether the social control as envisaged in Article 19 is being effectuated by restriction imposed on the Fundamental Right. The rights granted to a citizen by Article 19 do not confer any absolute or unconditional right. Each right is subject to reasonable restriction which the legislature may impose in public interest. It is therefore necessary to examine whether such restriction is meant to protect social welfare satisfying the need of prevailing social values. The reasonableness has got to be tested both from the procedural and substantive aspect. It should not be bound by procedural perniciousness or jurisprudence of remedies. How restriction imposed on Fundamental Right s guaranteed by Article 19 must not be arbitrary, unbridled, and uncanalised and excessive and also not unreasonably discriminatory. In judging reasonableness of restriction imposed under Article 19 (6), the court has to bear in mind directive principle of state policy. Ordinarily, any restrictions or imposed which has the effect of promoting effectuating a directive principle can be presumed to be reasonable restriction in public interest. ___________________________________________________\",\n",

In fact, here the newsprint policy became the newspaper control policy. While newsprint quota could be fixed on original basis, post-quota restriction could not be imposed. The newspapers should be left free to determine their pages, circulation and new editions within their fixed quota.

The direct effect is the restriction upon circulation of newspapers. The direct effect is upon the growth of newspapers through pages.

      "        \"Ratio\": \"The Supreme Court observed that no aspect of police surveillance falls within the scope of Article 19 (1) (d). The purpose of the street picketing was necessary to identify the visitor to suspect so that police might have some idea of activities and this did not affect his right of movement in any material form. Against the validity of showing of the suspects moment, it was argued that if a person suspected that his movements was being watched by police, it would induce him in a psychological inhibition against movement and this would infringe Article 19 (1) (d) which should be interpreted as postulating freedom not only from physical, but even psychological, restraints on a person\\u2019s moment. Rejecting this augment which advocated two broad view of the scope of safeguards granted by Article 19 (1) (d), The court ruled that Article 19 (1) (d) guarantees freedom from physical, direct and tangible restraints; it has no reference to \\u2018mere personal sensitiveness\\u2019, or \\u2018the imponderable effect on the mind of person which might guide his action in the matter of his moment or locomotion\\u2019. It was further held that domiciliary visit were also held to fall outside the scope of Article 19 (1) (d) as a knock at the door, or rousing a man from his sleep, does not impede or prejudice his locomotion in any manner. The minority view was that all acts of surveillance result in a close observation of suspect\\u2019s movement which infringes Article 19 (1) (d). If a man is shadowed, his movement is constricted. The flaw in the majority view of Kharak Singh that if there was no physical restraint on a person\\u2019s movement, then reasonableness of police surveillance could not be scrutinized under Article 19 (1) (d). The flaw in the judgement of Kharak Singh was removed by Supreme Court in Govind v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1975 SC 1378. The court has now held that police surveillance will have to be restricted to such person only against whom the reasonable materials exist to induce the opinion that they show a determination to lead a life of crime. Similarly domiciliary visit and secret picketing by the police would be restricted to the clearest case of danger to community security and should not be restored as a routine follow-up at the end of conviction or release from prison or at the whim of a police officer. The court gave a warning that these old regulation \\u2018ill-accord with the essence of personal freedom\\u2019, verge \\u2018perilously near unconstitutionality\\u2019 and, therefore, need to be revised. ___________________________________________________\",\n",

A restriction cannot be said to be unreasonable merely because it is in a given case, it operates harshly. In determining the infringement of the right guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g), the nature of right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed, the extent and urgency of evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time all needs to be determined accordingly. Thus, restriction to be reasonable must not be arbitrary or excessive in nature so as to go beyond the interest of general public. This formulation involves a balancing of private vis-a-vis public interest. In this process, the courts have learnt towards the consumer interest.

A nexus has been established between these three Articles. The theme of mutual relationship of Article 21 and 19 has already been discussed in several cases. This means that a law prescribing or procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty has to meet the requirement of Article 19. Also, the procedure established by law in Article 21 must answer requirement of Article 14 as well. The expression personal liberty in Article 21 was given an expensive interpretation. The court emphasised that the expression personal liberty is of the widest amplitude covering a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of man. Some of these attributes have been raised to the status of distinct Fundamental Rights and give additional protection under Article 19. The most significant and creative aspect of Maneka Gandhi, is the re-interpretation by the court of the expression procedure established by law and used in Article 21. The court gave following orientation to this expression: a. Article 21 would no longer mean that law would prescribe some semblance of procedure, however arbitrary or fanciful, to the private person of his personal liberty. It now means that procedure must satisfy certain requisite in the sense of being fair and reasonable. The procedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable. The concept of reasonableness must be projected in the procedure contemplated by Article 21. The Court has now assumed the power to adjust the fairness and justice of procedure established by law to deprive a person of his personal liberty. The Court had reached this conclusion by holding that Article 21, 19 and 14 are mutually inclusive and interlinked. b. The procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to conform with Article 14 for, in the word of Justice Bhagwati: \\u201cThe principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is in a sensual element of equality or non-arbitrariness permits Article 21 like a brooding omnipresence.\\u201d Thus, the procedure in Article 21, must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive, otherwise, it would be no procedure at all and the requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied. c. According to Justice Iyer the procedure in Article 21 means fairness, not formal, procedure; \\u2018law\\u2019 is reasonable law and not any enacted piece. This makes the word procedure established by law by and large synonymous with the procedural due process in the USA. This makes the right of hearing a component part of natural justice. d. As the right to travel abroad falls under Article 21, natural justice mode must be applied while exercising the power of impounding of passport under the passport act. Although the passport act does not expressly provide for the requirement of hearing before a passport is impounded, yet the same has to be implied therein.\",\n",

      "        \"Topic\": \"Right To Die, Passive Euthanasia Under Article 21 Background: The First Case: P. Rathinam v. Union of India, AIR 1994 SC 1844, wherein the court held that right to life embodied in Article 21 also embodied in it \\u2018right not to live\\u2019 a forced life, to his detriment, disadvantage or disliking. The view constituted an authority for the proposition that an individual has right to do as he pleases with his life and to end it if he pleases. The view expressed in P. Rathinam could not last for long and overruled by a constitutional bench of Supreme Court in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1996 SC 946. Issue in Gian Kaur: If attempt to commit suicide is not recorded as penal then what happens to someone who abets suicide which is punishable under Section 306, IPC? Factual matrix in Gian Kaur: Gian Kaur and her husband were convicted under Section 306, IPC, for abetting the commission of suicide by Kulwant, their daughter in law. Ratio in Gian Kaur: The Constitutional Bench of Supreme Court ruled that Article 21 is a provision guaranteeing protection of life and personal liberty and by no stretch of imagination can \\u2018extinction of life\\u2019 be read to include \\u2018protection of life\\u2019. Accordingly, the court has ruled that Article 309, IPC, is not unconstitutional. Therefore Section 306, IPC, has also been held constitutional. However, the Supreme Court has distinguished between euthanasia and attempt to commit suicide. Euthanasia is termination of life of a person who is terminally ill, or in a persistent vegetative state. In such a case, death is due to termination of life is certain and imminent. The process of natural death has commenced, it is only reducing the process of suffering due to natural death. This is not a case of extinguishing life but only accelerating conclusion of the process of natural death which has already begun. This may fall within the concept of right to live with human dignity up to the end of natural life. This may include the right of a dying person to die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But this cannot be equated with the right to die unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life. Ratio in present case: The five-judge bench of Supreme Court recognised and gave sanction to passive euthanasia and living will/advance directive. The implication of this is that from now \\u2018right to die with dignity\\u2019 is a Fundamental Right. The Supreme Court has clarified that the judgement in Gian Kaur case cannot be understood to have stated that passive euthanasia will be introduced through legislation. It further held that the word \\u2018life\\u2019 in Article 21 has been construed as life with dignity and it takes within the ambit the \\u2018right to die with dignity\\u2019 big part of the \\u2018right to live in dignity\\u2019. The sequitur of this exposition is that a dying man who is terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state can make a choice of premature extension of his life as being facet of Article 21 of the Constitution. If that choice is guaranteed under part of Article 21, there is no necessity of any legislation for effective waiting that Fundamental Right and more so his personal human rights. Indeed, that tried cannot be an absolute right but subject to regulatory measure to be prescribed by a suitable legislation which, however, must be reasonable restriction and in the interest of general public. Thus, the court has clarified that Article 21 covers within its ambit only passive euthanasia and not active euthanasia. In the present case, the Supreme Court has clarified that the \\u2018right to live with dignity\\u2019 also includes the smoothening of the process of dying in case of terminally ill patient or a person in permanent vegetative state with no hope of recovery and that is why it also recognises advance directive akin to a living well through which person of sound mind and in a position to communicate can indicate the decision relating to the circumstances in which withholding or withdrawal of medical treatment can be restored to. Elaborate procedure and safeguards for executing such advanced directive has been provided in the judgement with essential in gradient being that the treating physician of a terminally ill or patient undergoing prolonged medical treatment shall refer the matter to a medical board consisting of head of the treating department and at least three experts from the field of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology with experience in critical care and with overall standing in the medical profession. The decision of the medical board shall be communicated to the jurisdictional collector who shall constitute a medical board comprising the Chief District Medical Officer of the concerned district as the chairman and three expert doctor in the same field mentioned above. The chairman of the medical board sale after taking consent of the executor of advance directive or the guardian name therein, shall communicate his decision to the jurisdictional judicial magistrate first class, who shall than authorise the implementation of the decision of the medical board. The court has also laid down the procedure of altering the advance directive and for the cases where there are no directives. Thus, the Supreme Court has finally ruled that the interest of the patient cell override the interest of the state in protecting the life of a citizen and that the right to live with dignity attaches throughout the life of the individual.\",\n",

As the Fundamental Rights and directive principles are complimentary to each other, the content and parameters of this right or deduced in the light of Article 41, 45 and 46. Therefore, the \\u2018right to education\\u2019 in the context of this Directive Principle means: (a) every child has a right to free education up to the age of 14 years; (b) thereafter, his right to education is circumscribed by the limits of the economic capacity of the states and its development. The court has emphasised that child has Fundamental Right to free education upto the age of 14 years. This obligation can be discharged by the state either through governmental school, or private schools run by non-governmental bodies, aided and recognised by the state. The court further ruled that a citizen has a right to call upon the state to provide educational facilities within the limits of its economic capacity and development. The court has however cautioned that because it has relied upon some of the directive principles to locate the parameters of the \\u2018right to education\\u2019 implicit in Article 21, it does not follow automatically that each and every obligation referred to it in the Directive Principle gets automatically included with a preview of Article 21.

      "        \"Ratio\": \"The Supreme Court upheld the Act on all these grounds. The Court did recognize the importance of these three rights. They constitute the core of just causes because without them, it is difficult for any person to disprove the allegation made against him and to establish the truth. But two important consideration must be borne in mind in this regard: 1. There is no prescribed standard of reasonableness and, therefore, what kind of procedural rights \\u2018should be made available\\u2019 to a person depends upon the nature of the proceeding in relation to which the rights are claimed, 2. The question as to what kind of rights are visible to the detenu in the proceeding before the advisory board has to be decided in the light of constitutional provisions, and statutory provisions to the extent they do not offend the Constitution. The court ruled that a detenu should not claim the \\u2018right of cross examination\\u2019 of witness in the proceeding before the advisory board. The rules of natural justice are not rigid norms of unchanging content. The ambit of those rules must vary according to the context and they have to be tailored to suit the nature of proceedings in relation to which the particular right is claimed as a component of natural justice. Cross-examination may be necessary in the proceeding in which witness examined or documents are adduced in evidence in order to prove a point. Cross examination is a powerful weapon to expose the untruthfulness of such evidence. But the question of consideration of the advisory board is not whether the detainee is guilty of any charge but whether there is a recent cause for the detention. The detention is based not on the fact proved either by applying the test of preponderance of probabilities or of reasonable doubt, but on the subjective satisfaction of detaining authority. The proceeding of the advisory board has, therefore, to be structured differently from the proceeding of judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals. In case of preventive detention, witness is either unwilling to come forward, or the source of information of the detaining authority cannot be disclosed without detriment to the public interest. Therefore, in the very nature of things, it is not possible to give to the detenu the right of cross-examination of witness. Further, the court said that there is no objection in granting to the detenu right to lead evidence in rebuttal before the advisory board. There is no provision in the Constitution or the National Security Act denying to the detenu the right to present his own evidence but to rebut the allegation made against him. As the board is to complete its proceeding within a limited period, it can regulate its own procedure within the limits of Constitution and the statute and limit the time within which the detenu must complete the evidence.\",\n",

      "        \"Fact of the Case\": \"Because of famine conditions in the countryside, the Public Work Department of the State of Rajasthan started a road project as a famine relief measure and a large number of workers were employed on this project. The State was paying to this worker less than the minimum wages fixed for unskilled workers in the State. The State claimed that this was authorised by the Rajasthan Famine Relief Work Employees Exception from Labour Laws Act, 1964. The State argued that because of the exception act, the minimum wages act was not applicable to employees engaged on a famine relief work. The State argued that what it was doing was to provide relief to the person affected by drought and famine, and that its potential to help people would be very much reduced, and it would not be able to render help to maximum number of sufferers, if it were to give minimum wages to the workers. In other words of Justice Bhagwati, \\u201cwhere a person provides labour or services to another for remuneration which is less than the minimum wages, the level of service provided by him clearly falls within the meaning of word forced labour and address the condemnation of Article 23.\\u201d Whenever any labour or service is taken by the State from any person, even if the person is affected by drought and/or scarcity condition or not, the state must pay, at least, minimum wages to him/her to save violation of Article 23. Rejecting the argument of the State that it was providing relief to person affected by drought and famine, the Supreme Court held that though the plea of State might seem possible but it was unsustainable. The State is not giving dole or bounty to the affected persons, the work done by them is not worthless or useless to the society as to do so would be sheer waste of human labour and resources which could be usefully devoted to fruitful and productive channels leading to community welfare and creation of national wealth or asset. Therefore, if persons are employed in doing useful work, there can be no justification for the state not to pay the minimum wages. Justice Bhagwati observed on this point as follows; \\u201cThe State cannot be permitted to take advantage of helpless condition of the affected persons and extract labour or services from them on payment of less than the minimum wages. No work of utility and value can be allowed to be constructed on the blood and sweat of persons who are reduced to a state of helplessness on account of drought and scarcity conditions. The State cannot under the use of helping these affected persons extract work of utility and value from them without paying them minimum wages. Whenever any labour or services is taken by the state from any person, whether he be affected by brought, scarcity conditions or not, the state must pay, at least, minimum wages to such persons insofar as any exception provided by statute excludes the applicability of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 to workman employed on famine relief work and permits payment of less than minimum wages to such workmen, must be held to be invalid as offending the provisions of Article 23.\\u201d The expression forced labour in Article 23 is of the widest amplitude and on its true interpretation, it covers very possible form of forced labour, begar or otherwise, and it makes no difference whether the person is forced to give his labour or services to another is remunerated or not. Justice Bhagwati emphasise that Article 23 \\u201cis intended to eradicate the pernicious practice of forced labour and to wipe it out altogether from the national scene.\\u201d Therefore, the exception act which warranted payment of less than minimum wages on the five main relief work was held to be unconstitutional. The court therefore directed the state to pay to those workers the minimum uses and also to pay them the difference between the minimum wages and the actual wage paid for the past services.\",\n",
      "        \"Ratio\": \"The Supreme Court invalidated the payment by State of wages lower than the minimum wages to the person employed on the mild relief work under Article 23. Rejecting the arguments, the Supreme Court ruled that even those persons who are employed on the relief work should be paid the legal minimum wages and not less than that as that would be invalid under Article 23.\",\n",

The concept of secularism, is not expressly stated in the Constitution, was, nevertheless deeply embedded in the constitutional philosophy.\\u201d In 1976, though the 42nd amendment of the Constitution, the concept of secularism was made explicit by amending the preamble. By this amendment, the word secularism would introduce the preamble of the Constitution and thus, what was hitherto implicit was explicit.

There were three concurring and two dissenting judgements on the issue. The majority view was that the language being the basis for the establishment of different states, for the purpose of Article 30, holding victim and nobody will have to be determined in relation to the state in which the educational institution is sought to be established. The position with regard to the religious minority is similar, since both religious and linguistic minorities have been put on a par in Article 30. Therefore, the test for determining who are linguistic or religious minorities within the meaning of Article 30 would be one and the same either in relation to a state legislation or central l\\u00e9gislation. The minority view was that the question of minority status must be judged in relation to the offending pieces of legislation or executive order. If the source of the infringing action is the state, then the protection must be given against the state and this status of the individual or group claiming the protection must be determined with reference to the territorial limits of the State. When the entire nation is sought to be affected by Union legislation, the question of minority status must be determined with reference to the country as a whole. Thus, Parliament itself describe Hindi as the compulsory medium of instruction in all educational institution throughout the length and breadth of the country, if the minority status is to be determined only with respect to the territorial limits of a state, non-Hindi speaking person who are in majority in their own state but in a minority in relation to the rest of the country, would not be able to impinge the legislation on the ground that it interferes with the right to preserve distinct language and script. Such examples can be multiplied. The Supreme Court in TMA Pai was unanimously of the view that the right to establish and administer an institution in Article 30 of the Constitution, comprises the rights: a. To admit students, b. To set up reasonable fee structure, c. To constitute a governing body, d. To appoint staff (teaching and non- teaching), e. To take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of the employees. However, the court in TMA Pai did not decide about the authority competent to decide the minority status under Article 30. Further Constitutional development: The National Commission For Minority Educational Institution Act, 2004, was enacted which enables the commission set up under the act to decide all the questions relating to the status of any institution as a Minority Educational Institution and declare its status as such.\"\n",

It sought to remove economic imbalance by taking surplus land from the holders in excess of the ceiling. The bulk of the land has acquired was being distributed to the landless persons. Retaining a few blocks of land for cultivation of raw materials for industrial undertaking was meant to avoid fragmentation of this land and also to ensure that manufacturers were not starved of raw materials. This provision could not be detached from the rest of the act, the general scheme of which was to bring about agrarian reform. It was true that acquisition simpliciter of land by the state to augment its resources and without specifying the purpose of which it was to be used for acquisition would not get the protection of Article 31A. But vesting of some land in the State would not militate against the object of agrarian reform if it is a part of the general scheme of the agrarian reform and there was no oblique deviation from the avowed purpose. It was necessary to look at the general scheme of the act acquiring land, object of acquisition, reasons for retaining land with the state and not distributing it among the poor peasants. The court said that the concept of agrarian reform was not static.

      "        \"Judgment\": \"The Supreme Court has clarified that procedurally, under Article 32, it is not bound to follow the ordinary advisory procedure and made of such procedure as may be effective for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights. When writ petition was moved on behalf of some workmen that they were being held in bondage, the Court appointed two persons as commissioner to make report on petitioners condition. It was argued that the report had no evidentiary value since what was stated therein was based only on ex-party evidence, which had not been tested by cross examination. The Court held that argument not well founded and rejected it, as it was based on a total misconception of the true nature of proceeding under Article 32. Article 32 does not say by what proceeding the Supreme Court may be moved for enforcement of the Fundamental Right s. The only limitation is that the proceeding must be appropriate for the enforcement of Fundamental Right. The Constitution make a deliberately did not lay down any particular form a proceeding for enforcement of Fundamental Right not be they stipulate that such proceedings should conform to any rigid pattern or a straight jacket formula. The reason being that they realise that the people were poor and illiterate and insistence on any rigid formula would be self-defeating. Article 32 (2) confers power on the Court in its widest terms. It is not confined to issuing the high prerogative writs, but it is much wider and includes within its matrix power to issue any direction, order, writs which may be appropriate for enforcement of Fundamental Right in question. The Constitution is silent as to the procedure to be followed by the court in exercising its power under Article 32 (2) because the Constitution makers were anxious not to allow any procedural technicalities to stand in the way of enforcement of Fundamental Rights. The apex Court is bound by no procedure to do complete justice under Article 141 of the Constitution of India. Whatever procedure is necessary to fulfil the purpose is permissible to the court. It is not at all obligate tree for Court to follow adversarial procedure. No such restriction ought to be imposed on the court. In such a system of poor person is always at disadvantage against rich person. When a poor person come to the court for enforcement of their Fundamental Right, it is necessary to depart from the adversarial procedure and evolve a new procedure so as to enable such person to bring the necessary material before the court so as to a secure enforcement of their right. In the words of Justice Bhagwati: \\u201c we have therefore to abandon the laissez faire approach in the judicial process particularly where it involves a question of enforcement of Fundamental Right s and forge new tools, devise new methods and adopt new stages for purpose of making Fundamental Right s meaningful for the large masses of people. If we want the Fundamental Right s to become a living reality and the Supreme Court to become a real sentinel on the qui vive (on the alert or lookout), we must free ourselves from the cycles of outdated and outmoded assumptions and bring to bear on the subject fresh outlook and original unconventional thinking.\\u201d Accordingly, the court has accepted even a letter addressed to the court as an appropriate proceeding and has taken cognizance in the matter raised therein.

According to the court, the principal aim of a socialist state is to eliminate inequality in income, status and standard of life. The basic framework of socialism is to provide a decent standard of life to the working people and, is basically, to provide security from cradle to grave. This, among others on the economic side, envisages economic equality and equitable distribution of income. In the old age, socialism aim at providing an economic security to those who have rendered onto society what they were capable of doing when they were fully equipped with their mental and physical prowess. Article 41 enjoys the state to ensure a reasonably decent standard of life, medical aid, freedom from want, freedom from fear and enjoyable leisure, relieving the boredom and the humility of dependence in the old age.

In the words of Chief Justice Bhagwati; \\u201cthis, rule (Ryland v.

The enterprise must be held to be under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity in which it is engaged must be conducted with the highest standards of safety and if any harm results on the account of such activities the enterprise must be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it should be no answer to enterprise to say that it has taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without any negligence on its part.\\u201d The court also led down the measure of compensation payable within the capacity of enterprise, so that the same can have the different effect.

In making this assessment as to who as the Prime Minister will enjoy the confidence of Lok Sabha it is not fettered in his choice except by his own assessment. It was an unprecedented situation that such a government should give advice to the President which would be binding who could not sit in judgement on the political assessment of the present. Whether it was politically justified or not in appointing the Prime Minister is not a matter of Court to determine. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the President was legally and constitutionally justified in calling upon Charan Singh to form the ministry. Once the ministry was formed it was competent constitutionally to function and aid and advise the President in terms of Article 74 (1) until the Cabinet resigned on 20 August 1979. It was further observed that it was constitutionally within the discretion of President to accept the Cabinet advice to dissolve the Lok Sabha. The President was not bound to accept the advice, he was free to accept or not to accept that advice. The President did not act unconditionally in accepting that advice. After the Prime Minister and the Council of Minister tender his resignation, their continuance in office until alternative arrangements would be made as directed by the President was mandatory and imperative obligation for them as they held their office during President pleasure. The court however expressed the view that the government should not function only as caretaker government and carry out day to day administration and defer all policy questions which could await disposal by Council of Ministers responsible to Lok Sabha. This was so because the government had never proved its responsibility to Parliament, it resigned before facing a vote of confidence.\"\n",

Obviously, to avoid a conflict between duty and interest, to cut out the massive job of sale position to advance private benefit and to avoid the likelihood of influence in government to promote personal advantage. So, this is the mischief to be suppressed. At the sametime we have to bear in mind that our Constitution mandates the state to undertake multiform public welfare and social economic activities involving technical persons, welfare workers, and lay people on a massive scale so that participatory government may prove a progressive reality. In such an expending situation, can we keep out from elective post at various levels many doctors, lawyers, engineers and scientists, not to speak of any army of the other non-official who are wanted in various fields, not as full-time government servants but as part-time participant in People\\u2019s project sponsored by government? For instance, if a National Legal Service Authority funded largely by state comes into being, a large segment of the legal profession may be employed in ennobling occupation of legal aid to the poor.

For the purpose of disqualification, the office in question must be under the government. If the office is not under the government, no disqualification will arise. To determine whether a person holds an office under government, several tests which are ordinary applied are: Whether the government makes the appointment; Whether the government has right to remove or dismiss the holder of the office; Whether the government pays the renumeration; Whether the functions performed by the holder are carried by him for the government and Whether the government has control over the duties and function of the holder __________________________________________________\"\n",

      "        \"Judgment\": \"The five-judge bench of Supreme Court divided opinion into two. On the first point, the majority view is that ordinary law does not apply to acceptance of bribery by a member of Parliament in relation to proceeding in Parliament. The court gave a very broad interpretation of Article 105(2). On behalf of the majority, Justice Bharucha, has stated as under: \\u201cbroadly interpreted, as we think it should be, Article 105(2) protects a member of Parliament against proceeding in court that relate to, or concern, or have a connection or nexus with anything said, or a vote given, by him in Parliament.\\u201d The majority has ruled that while the bribe givers can claim no immunity under Article 105, the bribe takers stand on a different footing. The alleged bribe takers are set to have received monies as a motive or reward for defeating the no-confidence motion and, thus, the nexus between the bribe and a no-confidence motion is explicit. The majority judges have insisted that to enable members to participate fearlessly in Parliamentary debates, members need the wider protection of immunity against all civil and criminal proceeding that beer and access to their speech or vote. The reason for such a broad view is that otherwise a member who makes a speech or cast her vote that is not to the liking of powers that may be troubled by a prosecution alleging that he has been paid a bribe for the purpose. But a member who is alleged to have accepted bribe but has not voted cannot enjoy immunity under Article 105(2). Also, the members of the house who have given the bribe do not enjoy any immunity from prosecution. On this view, the majority held that four JMM members who had taken the money and put it against the motion were not guilty of corruption. But one member, Ajit Singh, who has taken the money but did not vote was held liable to be prosecuted. But the majority judges expressed the view, narrowly interpreting Article 105(2), that the immunity under Article which can be claimed is the liability that has arisen as a consequence of the speech that has been made for the vote that has been given in the Parliament. The minority judges have argued that the criminal liability incurred by a member of Parliament who has a accepted the bribe for speaking or giving his vote in Parliament in particular manner arises independently of the making of the speech or giving of vote by member and such liability cannot be regarded as the liability in respect of anything said or any vote given in the Parliament. On the second question mentioned above, all the judges are agreed that a member of Parliament or a State Legislature is a public servant under Section 2 (c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, because he holds an office and he is required and authorised to carry out a public duty, viz, effectively and fearlessly representing his constituency. Under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 a public servant cannot be prosecuted for certain offences without the sanction of competent authority, i.e, The authority competent to remove him from office. In the case of a member of Parliament or state legislature, there exists no such competent authority capable of removing him. Therefore, the majority view is that a member can be prosecuted for such offences, but after obtaining the permission of chairman or speaker as the case maybe of the concerned house. __________________________________________________\"\n",

      "        \"Fact of the Case\": \"Keshav Singh printed and published a pamphlet against a member of State Legislative Assembly. The house adjudged him guilty of committing its contempt and sentenced him to be reprimanded. On 16 March 1964, when the speaker administered a reprimand to him, he behaved in the house in an objectionable manner. Accordingly, the House directed that he be imprisoned for seven days for committing contempt of House by his conduct in the house at the time of being reprimanded by the Speaker. On 19 March 1964, advocate Solomon presented a petition under Article 226 to the Allahabad High Court for a writ of habeas corpus (to bring a party before a Court or a Judge) on behalf of Keshav Singh alleging that his detention was illegal as the house had no authority to do so; he had not been given an opportunity to defend himself and that his detention was mala fide (carried out in bad faith) and against natural justice. The court passed an interim bail order releasing cases in pending a full hearing of the petition on merits. Instead of filing a return to Keshav Singh petition, the house resolved pre-emptorily (to take action in order to prevent happening) that Keshav Singh, advocate Solomon and two judges of High Court who had passed the interim bail order, had committed contempt of the house and that they be brought before it in custody. The judge moved petition under Article 226 in the High Court asserting that the dissolution of the house was wholly unconstitutional and violated the provision of Article 211 [Article 121 in case of Parliament]; that in ordering release of Keshav Singh on the habeas corpus petition, The judges were exercising their jurisdiction and authority vested in them as judges of the High Court under Article 226. A full bench consisting of all the 28 judges of High Court ordered stay of the implementation of the resolution of the House till the disposal of the said petition. Thereafter, the house then passed a clarificatory resolution saying that its earlier resolution had given rise to misgiving that the concerned person would be deprived of an opportunity of explanation; that it was not so and the question of contempt would be decided only after giving an opportunity to explain to the judges. The warrant of arrest against two judges were withdrawn, but they were placed under an obligation to appear before house and explain why the house should not proceed against them for its contempt. The High Court again granted a stay order against the implementation of this resolution. Thus, there emerged a complete legislative judicial deadlock. At this stage, the President of India referred the matter to the Supreme Court for its advisory opinion under Article 143 of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court held that the two judges had not committed contempt of the legislature by issuing the bail order. The judges had jurisdiction and competence to entertain cases since petition and to pass the order as they did. The assembly was not competent to direct the custody and production before itself of the advocates and the judges. It was further held that the three wings of democratic state, viz, legislature, executive and the judiciary. The court emphasised that these three organs must function not in antimony, nor in a spirit of hostility, but rationally harmoniously. The Supreme Court in concerned to the first issue mentioned herewith held that the position appears to be that it is wrong to suppose that no Fundamental Right applies to the area of legislative privileges. Some Fundamental Rights, like Article 19(1)(a), do not apply. Perhaps, Article 19(1)(a) to Article 19(1)(g) would not apply. On the other hand, some Fundamental Rights, example, Article 21 do apply, while the position with regard to others, example, Article 22(1) and Article 22(2), is not clear. The Supreme Court in regard to issue number 2 mentioned herewith, the court retaliated to the judgement pronounced in MSM Sharma v. Sinha (I), AIR 1959 SC 395, wherein, on the one hand, the court decided the general question whether a breach of privilege occurs when a newspaper print a report including the portion ordered to be expunged by the Speaker. The court answered the question in the affirmative. But, on the other hand, when the question arose whether the expunged person had been printed by the newspaper or not, the court refused to express any opinion on this controversy saying that it must be left to the house itself to determine whether there has, in fact, been any breach of its privilege. Of course, when once it is held that a particular privilege exists, then it is for the house to judge the occasion and a manner of its exercise and the court would not sit in judgement over the way of the house has exercised its privilege. Each house of parliament in India has the power to commit a person for its contempt, but the position remains vague on the question whether such contempt is immune from judicial security or not. The Supreme Court pointed out that Article 211 [Article 121 in case of Parliament] debars the State Legislature from discussing the conduct of a High Court judge. Therefore, on a party of reasoning, one House, a part of the Legislature, cannot take any action against a High Court for anything done in the discharge of his duties. The existence of a fearless and independent judiciary being the basic foundation of the constitutional structure in India, no legislature has power to take action under Article 194 (3) or 105 (3) against a Judge for its contempt alleged to have been committed by a judge in the discharge of his duties. The court also held that right of the citizens to move the judicature and the right of the advocate to assist that process must remain and controlled by Article 105 (3) and Article 194 (3). It is necessary to do so for enforcing the Fundamental Rights and for sustaining the rule of law in the country. Therefore, a house could not pass a resolution for committing a High Court judge for contempt. The court rejected the contention of assembly that it had absolute power to commit a person for its contempt and a general warrant issued by it would be conclusive and free from judicial scrutiny. The court declared that House of Commons enjoyed the privilege to commit a person for contempt by non-justiciable general warrant, as a superior Court of record in the land and not the legislature. Therefore, Parliament and the state legislature in India, which have never been courts, cannot claim such a privilege.  Part V The Union Judiciary Article 124 to 147\",\n",

      "        \"Fact of the Case\": \"A Public Interest Litigation was filed in Supreme Court by lawyers association rising several crucial issues concerning the judges of Supreme Court and High Courts. The petition was considered by a bench of nine judges. Referring to the consultative process envisaged in Article 124(2) for appointment of Supreme Court judges, the Court emphasised that this procedure indicates the government does not enjoy primacy for \\u2018absolute discretion\\u2019 in the matter of appointment of Supreme Court judges. The court has pointed out that the provision for consultation with the Chief Justice was introduced because of the realisation that the Chief Justice is best equipped to know and assess the worth of the candidate and his suitability for appointment as a Supreme Court judge, and it was also necessary to eliminate political influence. The Court has also emphasise that the phraseology used in Article 124(2) indicates that it was not considered desirable to wish absolute discretion or power of veto in the Chief Justice as an individual in the matter of appointments so that there should remain some power with executive to be exercised as a check, whenever necessary. Accordingly, the Court observed as under; \\u201cThe indication is that in the choice of a candidate suitable for appointment, the opinion of Chief Justice of India should have the greatest weight, the selection should be made as a result of a participatory consultative process in which the executive should have a power to act as a mere check on the exercise of power of Chief Justice of India, to achieve the constitutional purpose. Thus, the executive element in the appointment process reduced to the minimum and any political influence is eliminated. It was for this reason that the word \\u2018consultation\\u2019 instead of \\u2018concurrence\\u2019 was used, but that was done merrily to indicate that absolute discretion was not given to anyone, not even to Chief Justice of India as an individual.\\u201d Thus, in the matter of appointment of a Supreme Court judge, the primary aim is to reach an exit decision taking into account the view of all the consultancies giving the greatest weight to the opinion of Chief Justice. When decision is reached by consensus, no question of primacy arises. Only when conflicting opinion emerged at the end of the process, the question of giving primacy to the opinion of Chief Justice arises, unless for a very good reason known to the executive and is disclosed to the chief Justice of India, the appointment is not considered to be suitable. The 3rd Judge Case: Re Special Reference, AIR 1999 SC 1 Background: Clarify certain points arising out of above judgement, the Supreme Court has delivered an advisory opinion on reference made by President under Article 143. In this opinion, the court has laid down the following proposition in regard to the appointment of Supreme Court judges: Observation: In making his recommendation for appointment to the Supreme Court, the chief Justice of India ought to consult four senior most puisne Judges of the Supreme Court. Thus, the collegium to make recommendations for appointment should consist of the Chief Justice and four senior most puisne Judges. The opinion of all the members of collegium in respect of each decision should be in writing. The views of senior most Supreme Court judge who has from the High Court from where the person recommended comes must be obtained in writing from consideration of collegium. If the majority of the collegium is against the appointment of a particular person, that person shall be appointed. The course he is gone on to say that \\u201cif even two of the judges forming the collegium expresses strong view, for good reason, that are adverse to the appointment of a particular person, the chief Justice of India would not press for such appointment.\\u201d The following exception have not been engrafted on the rule of seniority among the High Court judges for appointment to the Supreme Court: a. High Court judge of outstanding merit can be appointed as a Supreme Court judge regardless of his standing in the seniority list. All that needs to be recorded when recommending him for appointment is that he has outstanding merit. b. A High Court judge may be appointed as a Supreme Court judge for good reason from amongst several judges of equal merit, as for example, the particular region of the country in which his parents High Court is situated is not represented on Supreme Court bench. Thus, the responsibility to make recommendation for appointment as Supreme Court judges has been taken away from Central executive and has not been placed on collegium consisting of the chief Justice of India and four senior most puisne judges. The sphere of consultation has thus been broadened. Before this opinion was delivered, this collegium consisted of chief Justice and two senior most judges. The court has not specifically stated that an opinion formed by the chief Justice of India in any manner other than that indicated has no primacy in the matter of appointments to the supreme Court and the government is not obliged to act thereon. The 99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014 and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act of 2014 have replaced the collegium system of appointing judges to the Supreme Court and high courts with a new body called national judicial appointment commission NJAC. However, in 2015, the Supreme Court has declared on the 99th Constitutional amendment act as well as the NJAC act as unconstitutional and void. Consequently, the earlier collegium system became operative again. The verdict was delivered by the Supreme Court in fourth Judges case, 2015 [The Supreme Court advocates on record Association v.

The State Government brought a suit against the Centre under Article 131 for issue of a declaration that the notification appointing the commission was illegal and ultra vires. The main contention of the state was that the Commission of Enquiry Act does not authorise the Central Government to constitute a commission of enquiry in regard to matters falling exclusively within the state legislative and executive power. The crucial question arises was, whether the Central Government could appoint a commission to inquire into the contract of Chief Minister and other ministers of a state in the discharge of their governmental function. \\u201cThe object of Article 131 is to provide a high-powered machinery for ensuring that the Central Government and the State Government act within their respective spheres of their authority and do not trespass upon each other constitutional functions or powers.\\u201d It was also clarified that under Article 131, it is not necessary that the plaintiff should have some legal right of its own to enforce, before it can file a suit.

Therefore, a challenge by the State Government or the authority of the Central Government to appoint a commission of inquiry or to inquire into the allegation against the state ministers as regards the discharge of their concerns in the state clearly involved to question on which the existence of extent of the legal right of the Central Government to appoint such commission depended and that was enough to sustain the proceedings brought by the State under Article 131. ___________________________________________________\",\n",

Normally, the government is formed by the party commanding the required majority in the State. However, the issue has become more complex with a number of political parties in the fray. If a political party with the support of other political parties or other MLAs stake claim to form a Government and satisfies the Governor about its majority to form a stable Government, the Governor cannot refuse formation of the Government and override the majority claim because of his subjective assessment that the majority was cobble together by illegal and unethical means. The Governor summons house to meet at such times and places as he thinks fit. It is now a well-settled convention that the Governor summons the house not of his own accord but only with advised to do so by Council of ministers. It is the Council of Minister which provides business for a session of the legislature, and, therefore, it follows that for the Governor to act otherwise in accordance with such advice in the matter of summoning House of legislature would be without purpose. Six months should not intervene between the last sitting in one session of the house and date for his first meeting in the next session under Article 174 (1). ___________________________________________________\"\n",

This matter is governed by Article 233(1) of the Constitution according to which the appointment of district judges is to be made by the State Governor in consultation with the High Court under Article 233(1). A person not being in service of the state or of the Centre can be appointed only when recommended by High Court under Article 233(2). Some of the salient point which emerges from the court\\u2019s opinion are as under; The power of State Government to appoint district judges is not absolute and unfettered but is hedged in with restrictions. The power is conditioned by the requirement of consultation with the High Court. The power of appointment is an executive function of the government. The eligibility for appointment as a district judge by director depends entirely on the High Court\\u2018s recommendation. The State Government cannot appoint anyone from outside the panel of names forwarded by the High Court.

This means that there must be an interchange of views between the High Court and the State Government. On this point, the court has emphasised as under; \\u201cif the State Government were simply to give lip service to the principle of consultation and depart from the advice of the High Court in making judicial appointments without referring back to the High Court, the difficulties which prevent the government from accepting its advice, the consultation would not be effective and any appointment of a person as a district judge under Article 233(1) would be invalid.\\u201d Normally, as a matter of rule, the recommendation of the High Court for appointment of district judge should be accepted by State Government.

For some reason, the State Government did not want to accept the final list but it did not communicate its view to the High Court in the matter. The Supreme Court ruled that before rejecting the panel forwarded by the High Court, the government should have conveyed its view to the High Court to elicit its opinion.

The Court referred to work the law commission had shared in its 14 Report in the year 1958 from the portion of setting up of All India Judicial Services and observed: \\u201cthere is considerable force in the view expressed by the Law Commission. An All India Judicial Services essentially for manning the higher services in the subordinate judge receive is very much necessary. The reason advanced by the Law Commission for recommending the setting up of All India Judicial Services appeal to us.\\u201d The court has thus directed the Central Government and other authority concerned to take appropriate steps to set up and All India Judicial Services, and bring about uniformity in designation of judicial services. This requires action be taken under Article 312. In addition, the Supreme Court also directed various improvements being effectuated in the condition of service of the subordinate judiciary, example, raising the retirement age of 60 years, examination of the pay structure of judicial services, provisions for admissions for purchase of law books and journals for a residential library for every judicial officers, provision for residential accommodation, etc. Justifying the higher retirement age for judicial officer then the executive officer, the court has said that the work of a judge involves more of a mental activity than physical. In case of a judge court experience is an indispensable factor and subject to the basic physical fitness with growing age experiences. The court emphasised that \\u201cdispensation of justice is evitable feature of any civilised society\\u201d. The court also pointed out that income from \\u201cfee is more than the expenditure on the administration of justice. The court, therefore, suggested that \\u201cwhat is collected as Court-fee at least be spent on administration of justice instead of being utilised as a source of general revenue of the State\\u201d. The court has also suggested that provision must be made for in-service training of judicial officers.  Second Case: All India Judges Association v. UOI, AIR 1993 SC 2493 Background: The review petition was filed by several State Government and Central Government against the decision in All India Judges Association v UOI, 1992. They raised several objection to the direction given by Supreme Court in the abovementioned case. The main objection on their behalf were as under: It falls within the exclusive purview of each State to regulate service conditions for subordinate judiciary. When the Supreme Court gives direction for this purpose, it encroaches upon the state power; Implementation of the direction given by Supreme Court would impose a heavy financial burden on the state. Commenting on various objections raised by the various government to the direction issued by the court to improve the working condition of subordinate judiciary, the court stated that this was because of lack of realisation that judicial service is different from executive service. In this connection the court stated: \\u201cThe judicial service is not service in the sense of employment. The judges are not employees. As a member of judiciary, the excise the sovereign judicial power of the state.\\u201d The Supreme Court had prescribed the qualification of minimum of three years legal practice for recruitment in the lowest rung of judicial officers. The court also recommended that the service condition of judicial officer should be laid and reviewed by time to time by an independent commission exclusively constituted for the purpose.  The third case: All India Judges Association v. UOI, (2002) 4 SCC 247 The court has also answered the objection that by making the directions, the court was encroaching upon the powers of the State conferred by Article 309. The court has observed in this connection: \\u201cbut the mere fact that Article 309 gives power to the executive and the legislature to prescribe the service condition of judiciary does not mean that judiciary should have no say in the matter. It would be against the spirit of the Constitution to deny any role of judiciary in that we have, for critically it would not be impossible for the executive or the legislature to turn and twist the tail of the judiciary by using the said power. Such a consequence would be against one of the seminal mandates of the Constitution, namely, to maintain independence of judiciary.\\u201d Because of these reasons, the Supreme Court has reiterated what it said in its 1992 judgement for effectuating various improvements in the service conditions of the district and subordinate judges. The court has however modified somewhat this direction to raise the age of judgement to 60 years. The benefit of this extension in retiring age would not a cure automatically to all judicial officer irrespective of their past record of service and evidence of their continued utility to the judicial system in future. The benefit would be available only to those whom the High Court \\u201chave a potential for continued useful service.\\u201d   Part VIII The Union Territories Article 239 to 241\",\n",

The council had only advisory power regard to the legislative proposals, budget proposals and other matter referred to it by Lieutenant Governor. The Lieutenant Governor succeeded the Chief Commissioner as administrator of Delhi. After huge demand for legislative assembly, the government of India came up with constitution 69th Amendment Act, 1991 which formed Government of National Capital Territory Act, 1991 where in Delhi Legislative Assembly was introduced with Chief Minister and Council of Minister replacing the then Chief Executive Councilor and Executive councilors. Conflict between Government of Delhi and Government of India was seen when the Delhi Lieutenant Governor General Najeeb Jung denied sending files related with the affairs of police, public order and land. The decision of Najeeb Jung was backed by Home Ministry. Through the said notification it was notified that Delhi Anti-Corruption Branch could not investigate Central Government Employee\\u2019s because they have no jurisdiction to do so. Similarly, in 2015 when the Government of Delhi formed enquiry commission for investigating into CNG Fitness Scheme, the same was opposed by Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung, who referred the matter to Home Ministry. The Home Ministry ruled that the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi was not the competent authority to set up an enquiry commission, thus holding that the Delhi Government order was legally invalid and void ab initio. A petition based on such issues was filed before Delhi High Court. The Delhi High Court ruled that Lt Governor had complete control of all the matters regarding National Capital Territory of Delhi. Not satisfied with the High Court decision, the Government of Delhi appealed before Supreme Court. Status of Delhi under Constitution Administration of Union Territory under Article 239 (1) is different from Article 239AA which provides for an elected legislature. Parliament can legislate for Delhi on any matter in the state list and the concurrent list but the executive power in relation to Delhi except the police, land and public order vests only in the State Government headed by Chief Minister. It also held that the executive power of the Union does not extend to any of the matters which come within the jurisdiction of Delhi Assembly.

LG cannot refer every matter to the President Article 239AA (4) says that in the case of difference of opinion between the LG and his ministers on any matter, the LG shall refer it to the President for final decision and act according to it. However, the court inferred that the words \\u2018any\\u2019 matter employed in the proviso to Article 239AA (4) cannot be inferred to mean \\u2018every matter\\u2019. The power of Lt Governor under the said proviso represents the exception and not the general rule which has to be exercised in exceptional circumstances by LJ.

The Centre Government by a notification under Article 258 entrusted this power to the commissioner in the State of Bombay who were to exercise the power subject to the control of the State Government. Thereafter, the state of Gujarat was carved out of Bombay state, and a commissioner in Gujarat, acting under the original entrustment of power, took proceedings to acquire certain lands for the Union purpose. Section 87 of the State Reorganisation Act kept alive all laws prevailing in the State before reorganisation. When the commissioner power to acquire land was challenged, he filed a petition in Supreme Court. A distinction has been drawn between the functions entrusted and exercisable by President as under: Functions vested in the Union and exercisable by the President on behalf of Union; Functions interested to the President by express provision of the Constitution. Only the former functions, but not the latter, can be interested to the state under Article 258(1). In the latter category all such functions as the power to promulgate ordinance (Article 123), to suspend the provisions of Article 268 - 279 during an emergency (Article 354), to declare and emergency under Article 352, to declare failure of constitutional machinery of state under Article 356, to declare financial emergency under Article 360, to make rules for recruitment to and condition of service a person appointed to post and services in central services (Article 309), to appoint judges (Article 124 & 217), to appoint a Commission of Backward Class (Article 340), to appoint a special officer for the Scheduled Caste (Article 338) and President\\u2019s pleasure regarding Union Servant (Article 310). Secondly, what can be delegated under Article 258(1) is a function to which the executive power of Union extends. A question, therefore, arises whether under Article 258 (1) only an executive function can be interested to the State or even that is characterised as quasi-judicial or delegated legislation as well. The balance of judicial opinion so far is that only executive, and no other functions, can be delegated under Article 258(1). The majority in the Rana case left the question open as the function involved in the case was only administrative. It could thus mean that the power of delegated legislation and quasi-judicial nature, can be delegated by Centre to the state only if there is a statutory provision warranting the same and not under Article 258(1). ___________________________________________________  Part XII Finance, Property, Contract and Suits Article 264 - 300A Chapter I Finance Article 264 - 290a Central and State Taxes List Entries 82 - 92B Central Taxes Entry List 82 - 92-B & 96, 97 Taxes on income other than agricultural income - 82 Duties of customs including export duties - 83 Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except\\u2014 (a) alcoholic liquor\\u2019s for human consumption; (b) opium, Indian hemp and other narcotics drugs and narcotics, but including medicinal and toilet preparation containing alcohol or any substance included in sub - paragraph (b) of this Entry - 84 Corporation Tax - 85 Taxes on capital values of assets exclusive of agricultural land, of individuals and companies; taxes on the capital of companies - 86 Estate duty in respect of property other than agricultural land - 87 Duties in respect of succession of property other than agricultural land - 88 Terminal taxes on goods or passenger carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway fares and freights - 89 Taxes other than stamp duties on transactions in stock exchanges and futures markets- 90 Rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer of share, debentures, proxies and receipts- 91 Taxes on the sales or purchase of newspapers and on advertisements published therein- 92 Taxes on the sales or purchase of goods other than newspapers where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce - 92-A Taxes on the consignment of goods (whether the consignment is to the person making it or to any other person) where such consignment takes place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce - 92-B Fees in respect of any of the matters in the Union List, but not including fees taken in any Court, except the Supreme Court - 96 Any other tax not enumerated in List II and III - 97 State taxes Entries List 45 - 63 & 66 Land revenue including its assessment and collection - 45 Taxes on agricultural income- 46 Duties in respect of succession to agriculture land - 47 Estate duty in respect of agriculture land - 48 Taxes on lands and buildings - 49 Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral department - 50 Duties of exercise on the following goods manufactured or produced in the state and countervailing duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods manufactured or produced elsewhere in India: (a) alcoholic liquor for human consumption, (b) Opium, Indian hemp, and other narcotic drugs and narcotics, but not including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in such paragraph (b) of this entry - 51 Taxes on the entry of goods into a local area for consumption, use or sale therein \\u2013 52 (Repealed by 101st Amendment Act, 2016) Taxes on consumption or sale of electricity - 53 Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers, subject to the provisions of entry 92-A of list I - 54 Texas on advertisements other than those published in newspaper- 55 (Repealed by 101st Amendment Act, 2016) Taxes on goods and passengers carried by road or on inland waterways - 56 Taxes on vehicles, whether mechanically propelled or not, suitable for use on roads, including tramcars subject to the provisions of entry 35, List III \\u2013 57 (concurrent list) Taxes on animals and boats - 58 Tolls - 59 Texas phone professions, trades, callings and employment- 60 Capitation tax - 61 Taxes on luxuries including taxes on entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling- 62 Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than those specified in the provisions of List 1 with regard to rates of stamp duty - 63 Fees in respect of any of the matters in the list, but not including fees taken in any court - 66 Concurrent List Entry List 35, 44, & 47 Principles on which taxes on mechanically propelled vehicles are to be levied - 35 Stamp duties other than duties or fee collected by means of judicial stamps, but not including rates of stamp duty - 44 Fees in respect of any of the matters in the list, but not including fees taken in any court - 47  Residuary Taxes 97 Any other matter not eliminated in List I and List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those List  NOTE: There are more than hundred landmark judgement in the financial relations and taxing structure.

      "        \"Fact of the Case\": \"The petitioners who were agents for the sale of tickets for lotteries conducted by various State Governments other than the State of Maharashtra contended writ petition, that the aforesaid ban that was sought to be imposed had no legal authority. Under the Constitution, lotteries organised by Government of India or the Government of the State was a subject which was within the exclusive legislative competence of Parliament and that it was not open to the government of any state purporting to act in exercise of its executive power to impose such ban. On the behalf of the State Government, the respondent, it was contended that the Union government\\u2019s executive power was coextensive with the power to make laws, that the President in exercise of his power under Article 258 (1) had entrusted to the State Government that executive power of Union through a Presidential order in respect of lotteries run by the State, and therefore it was competent for the State Government to impose the ban. It was observed that Article 73 extends the execute the power of Union to the matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws. But the executive power of Union, by the way the opening words of Article 73 is \\u201csubject to the provisions of Constitution\\u201c. Therefore, it follows that executive power of Union with respect to lotteries organised by the Government of State has necessarily to be exercised subject to the provision of Constitution including Article 298, which expressly extends the executive power of the state to the carrying on of any trade or business subject only to legislation by Parliament if the trade or business subject only to which the state legislature may make laws. Reading and considering Article 73 and 298 together, it is clear that the executive power of a State in the matter of carrying on any trade or business with respect to which the state legislature may not make laws is subject to legislation by Parliament but is not subject to executive power of the Union. The Government of State is not required to obtain the permission of the Union Government in order to organise its lotteries, in the absence of Parliamentary legislation. Even assuming that such permission is necessary, a condition imposed by such permission that lottery tickets of one state may not be sold in another state cannot be enforced by the other state. The other state has no power to make any laws in regard to lotteries organised by the first state. The other state has no power to make law in regard to lotteries organised by first state. Its executive power, by the virtue of Article 298, extends to lotteries organised by itself but not to lotteries organised by other state. If a state Acts in breach of the conditions imposed by President while investing the power under Article 258 it is open to the President to revoke the permission or to take such further or other action as may be constitutionally permissible but it cannot possibly enable the government of other state to do anything about it except to complain perhaps to the Union government. ___________________________________________________ Chapter IV Right To Property Article 300A\",\n",

The deprivation of property shall be only by authority of law, be it an Act of Parliament or state legislature, but not by an executive fiat. The provision of property is by acquisition or requisition or taken possession of for a public purpose. The Court has also ruled that the law may fix an amount for which may be determined in accordance with such principles as maybe laid therein and given in such manner as may be specified in such law. However, such law shall not be questioned on the ground that the amounts of fixed or amounts determined is not adequate. The amount fixed must not be illusionary. The principal led to determine the amount must be relevant to the determination of amount. The court has further observed that it would, thus, be clear that acquisition of the property by law laid in furtherance of the Directive Principle of State Policy was to distribute the material resources of the community including acquisition and taking possession of private property for public purpose. It does not require payment of just compensation or indemnification to the owner of the property expropriated. It is very negation of the effectuating the public purpose. Payment of market value in lieu of acquired property is not sine qua non for acquisition. Acquisition and payment of amount are part of this scheme and they cannot be dissected. However, fixation of the amount or specification of the principles and the manner in which amount is to be determined must be relevant to the fixation of amount. The amount determined need not bear reasonable relationship. In other words, it is not illusory. The adequate advocacy of the resultant amount cannot be questioned in a court of law.

The purpose of the Act is to levy taxes on certain goods carried by road or inland waterway in the State of Assam. The appellant challenged the validity of the Act mainly on the ground that (1) the Act, rules and the notification under the act were ultra vires the Constitution, because the Act was repugnant to the provisions of Article 301 of the Constitution as the tax on carriage of tea through the State of Assam had the effect of interfering with the freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse; (2) that tea being a controlled industry under the provision of the Tea Act, 1953, the Union Government alone had the power to regulate the manufacture, production, distribution or transport of tea and jurisdiction of Assam Legislature was thus completely ousted; (3) that the tax under the act was nothing but a duty of excise, in substance, do not form, and was thus an encroachment to the central legislative field within the meaning of Entry 84 of the Union List. The impugned Act was also challenged on the ground that it was discriminatory and void under Article 14 of the Constitution. The competence of the Assam legislature to legislate on subject was also questioned. In drafting the relevant Articles 301 - 305 the makers of the Constitution were fully conscious that economic unity was absolutely essential for the stability and progress of the federal polity which had been adopted by the Constitution for the governance of the country. Political freedom had been won, and political unity had been accomplished by the Constitution, had to be sustained and strengthened by the bond of economic unity. It was realised that in the course of time different political parties believing in different economic theories or ideologies may come in power in the several constituent units of the Union and that mean conceivably give rise to local and regional pulls and pressures in economic matters. Local or regional fears or apprehensions raised by local or regional problems may persuade the state legislature to adopt remedial measures intended solely for the protection of regional interest without due regard to their effect on economic of the nation as a whole. The object of Article 301 to 305 was to avoid such possibility. Free movement and exchange of goods throughout the territory of India is essential for the economics of the nation and for sustaining and improving living standard of the country.

Accordingly, under Article 302, Parliament can impose a restriction on both inter-state as well as intra-state commerce. Inter-state and intra-state trade activities often have intimate inter - relationship. It was further observed that limitation introduced in Article 303(1) cannot circumscribe the scope of Article 301. Thus, the rigours of the limitation imposed on Parliament by Article 303(1) are relaxed somewhat by Article 303(2). Under Article 303 (2), Parliament may prefer one state over another, or discriminate between the states, if it is declared by law made by Parliament that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of India. In other words, when Parliament is faced with the task of meeting an emergency created by the scarcity of goods in any particular part of India, Parliament may enact a law-making discrimination, or giving preference, in favour of the part, thus, affected. Such a declaration by Parliament would be conclusive and not justiciable.

The underlying purpose of this move seems to be to grab the powers of the Chief Election Commissioner who was single handily exercising the power of the Election Commission. In 1989, by notification issued under Article 324 (2), was fixed at two. By another notification, the President appointed the petitioner and one other person as Election Commissioners as such. The rules made by the President under Article 324 (5) fixed the tenure of these commissioners at five years, or until reaching the age of 65 years, whichever was earlier. Hitherto, the election commission had consisted of only one member, viz, The Chief Election Commissioner. With the addition of two more members, the smooth working of commission was adversely affected. Accordingly, on 1 January 1990, the President issued two notifications under Article 324(2) rescinding the 1989 notifications creating the two post of Election Commissioners and appointing two persons to these posts. In this way, from 1990, the election commission again reverted to a one-man body. The question arose whether the notification was constitutionally valid?\",\n",

      "        \"Judgment\": \"The Supreme Court observed that when an institution like the election commission is entrusted with the vital functions, and is armed with exclusive and uncontrolled powers to execute them, it is both necessary and desirable that the power not exercised by one individual. However, as wise as he maybe, \\u201cit will-conforms to the tenant of democratic rule.\\u201d When most powers are exercised by an institution which is accountable to none, it is politic to entrust it\\u2019s a fair or more hands then one. It helps to assure judiciousness and want of arbitrariness. After release of the provisions of Article 324, and review of the debates held in constitute assembly on the matter at issue, the court laid down the proposition that under Article 324 (1), The status of election commissioner is not pari passu (side by side) with that of the Chief Election Commissioner. The Chief Election Commissioner has been given protection in that his conditions of service cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment, and he cannot be removed from his office except in like manner and only grounds as a judge of Supreme Court. These protections are not available to the election commissioners. Their conditions of service can be varied even to their disadvantage after their appointment and they can be removed on the recommendation of chief election Commissioner. These provisions indicate that the Chief Election Commissioner is not primus inter pares, i.e, first among the equals, but is intended to be placed in a drastically higher position than the Election Commissioners. In this context, the court held both the 1990 notifications as valid. Article 324 (2) leaves it to the President to fix and appoint such member of Election Commissioner as he may from time to time determined. The power to create the post is unfettered. So, also is the power to reduce or abolish them. If the President decide to abolish both the post of Election Commissioner either because there was no work for them, or that the election commission could not function, there could be nothing wrong with it.\"\n",

Similarly, the President can specify caste, race or tribe or part thereof in relation not only to entire state, but in relation to parts of the state where he is satisfied that the examination of social and educational backwardness of the race, caste or tribe justifies such specifications.

UOI, AIR 1994 SC 1918 Background: In 1989, the Janta Dal Ministry headed by Shri SR Bommai was in office in Karnataka. A number of members defected from the party and there arose a question mark on the majority support in the house of the Bommmai\\u2019s ministry. The Chief Minister proposed to the Governor that the assembly session be called to test the strength of the ministry on the floor of the house. But the Governor ignored this suggestion. He also did not explore the possibility of an alternative government but reported to the President that as Bommai had lost the majority support in the house, and as no other party was in a position to form the government, action be taken under Article 356 (1). Accordingly, the President issued the proclamation under in April, 1989. Bommai challenged the validity of the proclamation before the Karnataka High Court through a writ petition on various grounds. The High Court ruled that the proclamation issued under Article 356(1) is not wholly outside the scope of judicial scrutiny; The satisfaction of the President under Article 356 (1) which is a condition precedent for the issue of the proclamation ought to be real and genuine satisfaction based on relevant facts and circumstances. The scope of judicial scrutiny is therefore confined to an examination within the disclosed regions where any regional access to the action proposed for proclamation issued. The court may examine as to whether the proclamation was based on satisfaction which was mala fide for any reason, or based on wholly extraneous and irrelevant grounds. In such a situation, the stated satisfaction of the President would not be a satisfaction in a constitutional sense under Article 356. In the end, however, the High Court dismissed the petition holding that effect stated in the Governors report could not be held to be irrelevant. Governors bona fides were not questioned and his satisfaction was based on reasonable assessment of all facts. The court also ruled that recourse to floor test was neither compulsory nor obligatory and was not a breeding visit to the sending of the report to the President. S.R. Bommai appealed the decision of High Court before Supreme Court. Besides, there were three more proclamations before the Supreme Court for the review\\u2014 those made in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan in 1992 in the wake of the demolition of the disputed Babri structure in Ayodhya.\",\n",

A bench of nine-judge was constituted in Bommai to consider the various issues arising in several cases, and several opinion were rendered. On the basis of consensus among the judges, the following propositions can be enunciated in relation to Article 356 (1) and the scope of judicial review thereunder; The President exercises his power under Article 356 (1) on the advice of the Council of Ministers which, in effect, the power really belongs maybe formally vested in the President. The question whether the incumbent state Chief Minister has lost his majority support in the assembly has to be decided not in the Governor\\u2019s chamber but on the floor of the house. There should be test of strength between the government and other on the floor of the house before recommending imposition of President\\u2019s rule in the state. The governor should explore the possibility of installing an alternative ministry, when the erstwhile ministry loses support in the house. The validity of the proclamation issued under Article 356, justiciable on such grounds as: whether it was issued on the basis of any material at all, or whether the material was relevant, or whether the proclamation was issued in the malafide exercise of the power, or was based only on extraneous and/or irrelevant grounds. There should be material before the President indicating that the Government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution. The material in question before the President should be as would induce a reasonable man to come to the conclusion in question. When a prima facie (based on the first impression) is made out against the validity of the proclamation, it is for the Central Government to prove that the relevant material did in fact exist. Search material maybe the report of the Governor or any other material. The dissolution of the legislative assembly in the state is not an automatic consequence of the issuance of the proclamation. The dissolution of assembly is also not a must in every case. It should be done only when it is found to be necessary for achieving the purpose of the proclamation. The provisions in Article 356 (3) are intended to be a check on the power of President under Article 356(1). If the proclamation is not approved within two months by two houses of Parliament, it automatically lapses. This means that the President ought not to take any irreversible action till the proclamation is approved by the house of Parliament. Therefore, the state assembly ought not to be dissolved. Once the proclamation is approved by Parliament, and then at the end of six months, or it is revoked earlier, neither the dismissed the State Government, nor the dissolved legislature will revive. If the court invalidates the proclamation, even if approved by the Parliament, the action of the President becomes invalid. The State Government, if dismissed, is revived and the state assembly, if dissolved, will be restored. Article 74(2) bars an enquiry into the question whether any or what advice was tendered by the Council of Ministers to the President. Article 74(2) \\u201cdoes not bar the court from calling upon the Union Council of Ministers to disclose to the court the material upon which the President had formed the requisite satisfaction. The material on the basis of which advice was tendered does not become part of the advice. Even if the material is looked into by or shown to the President, it does not partake the character of advice\\u201d. The Supreme Court, in this case, seeks to promote basic and wholesome constitutional values, society, Parliamentary system, federalism, control over the executive and secularism.

      "        \"Fact of the Case\": \"This is the first case on amendability of the Consultation, the validity of the Consultation (First Amendment) Act, 1951, curtailing the right to property guaranteed by Article 31 was challenged. The argument against the validity of the First Amendment was that Article 13 prohibits enactment of a law infringing or abrogating the Fundamental Rights, that the word \\u2018law\\u2019 in Article 13 would include any law, even a law amending the Constitution and, therefore, the validity of such a law could be judged and scrutinised with reference to the Fundamental Rights which it could not infringe. The court held that the terms of Article 368 are perfectly general and empower Parliament to amend the Constitution without any exception. The Fundamental Rights are not excluded or immunised from the process of constitutional amendment under Article 368. These rights could not be invaded by the legislative organs by means of laws and rules made in exercise of legislative power but they could certainly be curtailed, abridged or even nullified by alteration of the Constitution itself in exercise of the constituent power. The Court, thus, disagreed with the view that the Fundamental Rights are inviolable and beyond the reach of the process of the constitutional amendment. The Court, thus, ruled that Article 13 refers to a \\u2018legislative\\u2019 law, i.e, an ordinary law made by a legislature, but not to a constituent\\u2019 law, i.e, a \\u2018procedure\\u2019 laid down in Article 368 amend any Fundamental Right.  Case Second: Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1965 SC 845 Background: The validity of the Constitutional (17th Amendment) Act, 1964 was called in question. This Amendment again adversely affected the right to property. By this amendment, number of statutes affecting property rights were placed in the 9th Schedule and were, thus, immunised from Court review. Whether the amendment of the Constitution insofar as it purported to take away or abridged the Fundamental Rights was within the prohibition of Article 13(2)? Whether Article 31A and 31 B (as amended by the 17th Amendment) sought to make changes to Articles 132, 136 and 226, or in any of the Lists in the 7th Schedule of the Constitution, so that the conditions prescribed in the proviso to the Article 368 had to be satisfied? The conclusion of the Supreme Court in Sankari Prasad case as regards the relation between Article 13 and 368 was reiterated by the majority. It felt no hesitation in holding that the power of amending the Constitution conferred on Parliament under Article 368 could be exercised over each and every provision of the Constitution. The majority refused to accept the argument that Fundamental Rights were \\u201ceternal, and beyond the reach of Article 368.\\u201d  The Third Case: LC Golak Nath v. State of Punjab, AIR 1967 SC 1643 Whether any of the Fundamental Right could be abridged or taken away by the Parliament in exercise of its power under Article 368?  The majority took the position that Fundamental Rights occupy a \\u201ctranscendental\\u201d position in the Constitution, so that no authority functioning under the Constitution, including Parliament exercising the amending power under Article 368, would be competent to amend the Fundamental Rights. Chief Justice Subba Rao on behalf of himself and four other judges, equated Fundamental Rights with natural rights and characterised them as \\u201cprimordial rights necessary for the development of human personality\\u201d. It was established that when Parliament would not affect Fundamental Right by enacting a bill in its ordinary legislative process even unanimously, how could it then abrogate a Fundamental Right with only 2/3 majority? While Articles of less significance require consent of majority of states, can Fundamental Rights be amended without such consent? While overruling the judgement passed in Shankari Prasad and Sajjan Singh case, the Supreme Court held that the term law in a comprehensive sense would take in even constitutional law. The court formulated its position as follows, \\u201can amendment of the Constitution is law within the inclusive definition of law under Article 13 (2) of the Constitution and, as the entire scheme of Constitution was to list postulates the inviolability of Part III thereof, Article 368 shall not be so construed as to destroy the structure of our Constitution.\\u201d   The Fourth Case: Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 1461 The constitutional validity of XXIV and XXV Amendment was challenged? The court held that the power to amend Constitution is to be found in Article 368 itself. It was emphasised that the \\u201cprovisions relating to the amendment of the Constitution are some of the most important feature of any modern constitution\\u201d. Further, the court recognised that there is a distinction between an ordinary law and a constitutional law. Kesavananda did not concede an unlimited amending power to Parliament under Article 368. The amending power was now subjected to one very significant qualification, viz, That the amending power cannot be exercised in such a manner as to destroy or emasculate the basic or fundamental features of the Constitution. A constitutional amendment which opens the basic structure of constitution is ultra vires. Some of the features regarded by the court as fundamental and, thus, non-amendable are: I. Supremacy of the Constitution, II. Republican and democratic form of government, iii. Secular character of the Constitution, IV. Separation of power between legislative, executive and the judiciary, V. Federal character of the Constitution e. Therefore, it means that while Parliament can amend any constitutional provision by virtue of Article 368, such a power is not absolute and unlimited and the court can still go into the question whether or not an amendment violates or fundamental or basic feature of the Constitution. If an amendment does so, it will be constitutionally invalid. f. What is the fundamental feature of the Constitution is a moot point. The list given above is not final or exhaustive of such features. It is for the courts to decide as and when a question arises whether a particular amendment of the Constitution affects any basic or fundamental features of the Constitution or not. The question of basic feature has to be considered in a case in the context of concrete problem. f. It was further held that, Can Parliament under Article 368 rewrite the entire Constitution and bring a new constitution? The answer to the question is that Parliament can only do that which does not modify the basic feature of the Constitution and not beyond that.  Development in the Concept after Keshavananda Bharti Case Background: A writ petition was filed in Supreme Court challenging the taking over of the management of the mills under the Sick Textile Undertaking (Nationalisation) Act, 1974, and in order made under Section 18-A of the Industrial (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. The petition challenged the constitutional validity of clause (4) & (5) of Article 368, introduced by Section 55 of the 42nd Amendment. If these clauses were held valid then the petitioners could not challenge the validity of the 39th Amendment which had placed the Nationalisation Act, 1974, in schedule IX Schedule. The court observed that depriving the Courts of the power of judicial review will mean making Fundamental Rights \\u201ca mere adornment\\u201d as they will be rights without remedies. A controlled Constitution will become uncontrolled. It was held that the goals set out in Part IV of the Constitution, Directive Principles of State Policy, must be achieved without the abrogation of means provided for by party which is Fundamental Rights. In this sense, Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy both together constitute the core of the Constitution and combine to form its conscience. Anything that destroys the balance between the two parts will ipso facto destroy an essential element of the basic feature of the Constitution. Background: The Constitution validity of Maharashtra Agricultural (Land Ceiling) on Holding Act, 1967 was challenged. The Act imposed ceiling on agricultural holding in the state. As the Act had been placed in the 9th Schedule, the constitutional validity of Article 31A and 31B and an unamended Article 31C was also challenged on the ground of damaging the 'basic structure\\u2019 of the Constitution. These laws would not receive the protection of Article 31B ipso facto. Each law has to be examined individually for determining whether the constitutional amendment by which it has been put in the 9th schedule damages or destroys the basic feature of the Constitution in any manner. If, however any such Act is protected by Article 31A or 31C (as stood prior to the 42nd Amendment) then the act will be valid. Article 31C as it stood prior to the 42nd amendment made in 1976 is valid to the extent it constitutionally has been upheld in Kesavanand Bharati case. Laws passed for giving effect to the directive principles in Article 39 (b) & (c) \\u201cwill fortify that structure\\u201d. The Court expressed the hope that Parliament would utilise to the maximum its potential to pass laws genuinely and truly related to the principles contained in Article 39 (b) & (c). ___________________________________________________  Part XXI Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions Article 369 - 378A President Order of 2019: Deleting Article 370 from the Constitution of India.  On 5 August 2019 the Government of India issued the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 2019 under Article 370, suspending the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954. Thus, the special provision which was granted to State of Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 was passed to convert Jammu and Kashmir status of State into two separate Union territories. Hereafter, all the acts, rules and regulation, and the entire Constitution of India will be applicable on Jammu and Kashmir. The special status guaranteed to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 35A was also abrogated.  The constitutional validity of the said order, 2019 was challenged before the Supreme Court of India.  Bench Justice N.V. Ramana, Justice S.K. Kaul, Justice R. Subhash Reddy, Justice B.R. Gavai, Justice Surya Kant Fact of the case: The case pertains to the constitutional challenge before the Supreme Court as regard to two constitutional orders issued by President of India in excise of his power under Article 370 of the Constitution of India. These Constitution orders made the Constitution of India applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir in its entirety, like other states in India. When can a matter be referred to a larger bench? Whether there is a requirement to refer the present matter to a larger bench in the view of the earliest contradictory view of this Court in Prem Nath Kaul case and Sampath Prakash case? Whether Sampath Prakash case is per incuriam for not taking into consideration the decision of court in Prem Nath Kaul case? Prem Nath Kaul v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, AIR 1959 SC 749: The Supreme Court held that the constitutional relationship between the State of Jammu and Kashmir and the Union of India should be finally decided by the constituent assembly of the State and, therefore, he has to be treated as a temporary provision. Sampat Prakash v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, AIR 1970 SC 1118: The Supreme Court reversed the judgement of Prem Nath and held that Article 370 as a permanent provision giving perennial power to the President to regulate the relationship between the state and the Union of India. It was held that the contacts of Prem Nath Kaul case was different, as it was dealing with the validity of legislation passed by the Yuvraj of Jammu and Kashmir before the sitting of the constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir. Thus, it was her that there is no conflict between the judgements in Prem Nath Kaul case and the Sampath Prakash case. The plea of counsel to refer the present matter to a larger bench on this ground is therefore rejected.

This was not an issue in the question before this Court, unlike in the Sampat Prakash case where the contention was specifically made before and refuted by, the court. This court sees no reason to read into the Prem Nath Kaul Case and interpretation which result in it being in conflict with the subsequent judgement of this court, particularly when an ordinary reading of the judgement does not result in such an interpretation.\"\n",
