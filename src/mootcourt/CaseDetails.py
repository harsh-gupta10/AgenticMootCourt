ALERT INDIVA Vs. STATE OF BRAMHA AND OTHER

The State of BRAHMA is one of the States in Indiva Due to wrath of nature the state is facing an acute scarcity of water and the condition in major part of the state
is near to drought. To meet this situation, the state of BRAMHA has taken a policy decision to construct the number of dams in the State so that the rainy water could be accumulated in the
dams which would help in meeting the growing needs of water for the purpose of drinking, agriculture and also for the Industries.  The Government is also of the
opinion that the accumulation water in the dams would help in recouping the underground water level in the state.  One of such dams is to be constructed in a district which is more severely affected. The construction of the dam would affect ten villages which are adjoining to the
location of the dam.  The villagers have agriculture as their main occupation and as a consequence of the water stored in the dam, their agricultural fields would either
be submerged or get water logged which would deprive them of their right to livelihood. The state of BAMHA for the purpose of the construction of dam had floated global
tenders and one of the companies, Reliable Industries limited has been given a contract to construct a dam. The reliable industries limited for the purpose of construction of the dam had applied
for environment clearance to the Ministry of Environment and Forest for the purpose.

Environment clearance has been given to the company on the ground that the
Government has an authority to do so in larger public interest.  The agriculturist in the village are also not in favour of the construction of the dam
since they would be displaced from the land where the dam is to be constructed and
would be deprived of their livelihood. "Alert Indiva" is NGO which for the protection of environment in Indiva. "Alert
Indiva" which is fighting for the cause of environment has appealed to the
Government not to proceed with the construction of the dam since it would lead to
an environmental imbalance in the State.  However the state of BRAMHA is determined to proceed with the construction of
dam in public interest. "Alert Indiva" has therefore filed a petition under Art.226 and Art.227 of the
Constitution of Indiva on the ground that the Environment Clearance Certificate
granted is bad in letter and spirit of the constitution and against the national interest.  "Alert Indiva" has also taken the cause of the agriculture who are likely to be
displaced and has submitted that the construction of the said dam is in violation of
Art.21 of the constitution of Indiva as regards right to life and Personal liberty of the
agriculturists in the area.  The High Court of Judicature of Bramha has admitted the petition for hearing and
has framed the following issues for the purpose of adjudication. 

Issue No.01
Whether the present petition has been field in public interest and therefore maintainable as a Public Interest Litigation? 

Issue No. 02
Whether the Writ Petition filed under Art.226 and Art.227 of the Constitution of Indiva is Maintainable?

Issue No. 03
Whether the High Court of BRAMHA can interfere in any policy decision taken by the State of BRAMHA? 

Issue No. 04
Whether the displacement of the agriculturists from the area where the proposed dam is to be constructed amounts to violation of Art. 21 of the Constitution of Indiva? 

Issue No. 05
Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted by the State is contrary to the provisions of Constitution of Indiva? 

Issue No. 06
Whether the decision taken by the State of BRAHMA to construct the dam deserves to be maintained or should be quashed and set aside?

**Note**: Laws of Indiva are the same as laws of India.

SOCIETY FOR EQUITY V. UNION OF FONDA

1.  The Union of Fonda is a multicultural society, where the inhabitants,
belonging to different ethnic backgrounds, speak different languages and
practice different religious faiths. The national motto has always been 'unity
in diversity'.

2.  Soon after the elections, the Central Government took initiative to fulfill the
election promise which included a legislative protection to the private choice
of the individuals. 
3.  The Parliament, accordingly, enacted the "Protection of Private Choice Act,
2016", inter alia, permitting the owners of the residential premises in urban
areas, to freely choose the tenants and lessees. However, the Act prohibited
discrimination against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
4.  Taking advantage of the law, the owners of the residential premises in urban
area immediately started openly advertising in the dailies, inviting tenants and
lessees.The advertisements typically stated-"only married couples", "only
vegetarians", etc.  Some in their advertisement, even openly added- "no
minorities", "no single women". The women working in the film industry, in
fashion designing, hospitality, etc, became the main target of the hostile
discriminations. 
5.  When a cine actress, who was a unwed mother, wanted an apartment near the
school where her child was admitted, she failed in getting a lease for the
apartment;
the owner declined to lease the apartment at the insistence of the
Resident's Welfare Association that no lease should be given to single unwed
mother and cine actress or actor. 
6.  The "Society for Equality", an NGO, led by an actress, Ms. Ramya Singh,
filed a Writ Petition in the supreme court of fonda challenging the
constitutional validity of the Act of 2016, inter alia, contending that it is a
legislative disguise for reinventing and promoting the historical
discriminations embedded in the society.  She alleged that the Act of 2016 is 
the antithesis of private equality as reflected in the Equality as reflected in the 
Equality Act of 2010 enacted by the British parliament. She further 
emphasized that the provisions of the impugned Act of 2016 are wholly 
contrary to the constitutional philosophy of equality. However, the union of 
fonda (UFO) filed its reply defending the act of 2016 on the ground that the 
Art 14 does not apply to the individuals.  The UFO further contended that the 
provisions of impugned Act of 2016 execute the constitutionally guaranteed 
freedom to make private choices. 
7.  At the admission Stage, the attorney general appeared for the UFO and sought 
reference of the Writ petition to the constitution bench of five judges on the 
grounds that a substantial question of law as the interpretation of the 
constitution arises - in as much as ,the freedom trumps over equality in case 
of conflict between the two .However , the division bench of two judges 
declined to refer the matter to five judges, but referred it to a bench of one
judge. 
**Note**: Fonda means India for the purpose of this case.
