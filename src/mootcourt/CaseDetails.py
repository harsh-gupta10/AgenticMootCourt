**PQR & Ors v. State of Mahadpur**  
The State of Mahadpur amended the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, imposing a **total ban on transportation, slaughter, import, and possession** of cow, bull, and bullock flesh. Sections 9A & 9B place the burden of proof on the accused. The petitioners challenge the amendments as violating:  
- **Article 21** (Right to Privacy & Personal Choice).  
- **Article 19(1)(g)** (Freedom of Trade).  
- **Article 25 & 29** (Religious & Cultural Rights).  
The State defends the law, citing **reasonable restrictions, Directive Principles, and animal rights**. The Supreme Court must decide the constitutional validity of the ban.
