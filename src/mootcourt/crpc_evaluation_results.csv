"CRPC","What is the purpose of Section 3 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973?","To the Petitioner and Respondent:  My questions pertain to Section 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  While my attempts to locate the precise text within the provided tools have been unsuccessful, I understand its general purpose is to define the territorial extent and application of the Code.  Therefore, my questions will focus on testing your understanding of this scope and any limitations it might impose.  1.  **Petitioner:**  Explain, in your own words, the purpose of Section 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  What are the key implications of this section for the application of the Code within India's territory?  2.  **Respondent:**  Section 3 likely addresses the geographical limits of the Code's applicability.  Are there any exceptions or limitations to this geographical scope?  Provide specific examples to illustrate your answer.  3.  **Petitioner & Respondent (Joint):**  Imagine a scenario where a crime is committed on an Indian ship in international waters.  Would the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, apply in this situation?  Justify your answer with reference to the principles underlying Section 3 and any relevant legal precedents.  How would the application of the Code differ if the crime was committed on foreign soil but involved an Indian citizen?  4.  **Petitioner:**  Let's assume a situation where a dispute arises regarding the application of the Code in a newly acquired territory.  What legal mechanisms are available to resolve this dispute, and what role does Section 3 play in this process?  5.  **Respondent:**  How does Section 3 interact with other provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and other relevant laws, to ensure a consistent and just application of criminal law throughout India?  Provide specific examples to illustrate the interplay between Section 3 and other legal provisions.   These questions aim to assess your understanding of the purpose and implications of Section 3, CrPC, 1973, and your ability to apply this understanding to hypothetical scenarios.  Your answers should demonstrate a thorough grasp of the legal principles involved and be supported by relevant legal arguments and, if possible, case law.","Construction of references","4.0536223217769254e-232","0.011235954724782235","0.0","0.011235954724782235","0.29820775985717773"
"CRPC","Which section of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is about 'Construction of References'?","There is no specific section in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, explicitly titled ""Construction of References.""  The interpretation of references within the CrPC, like any other statute, is governed by general principles of statutory interpretation.  These principles are not codified in a single section but are applied judicially based on established legal precedents and principles of interpretation.  The court would look to the definitions section and other relevant sections to understand the meaning of terms and phrases used within the CrPC.","Section 3","5.882492291217442e-232","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.3926398754119873"
"CRPC","What is regulated under Section 4 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973?","I cannot answer your question definitively without access to the text of Section 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. My searches in the provided databases did not yield the relevant section.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) has largely replaced the CrPC, 1973, making it difficult to access the precise wording of Section 4 from the older code.  While I found a Supreme Court case referencing the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it did not directly address Section 4.  To answer your question accurately, I require access to the original text of Section 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.","Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws","7.32173788293977e-232","0.08571428306530622","0.0","0.08571428306530622","-0.10298017412424088"
"CRPC","Under which section in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is the trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws regulated?","There is no single section in the repealed Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, that solely regulates the trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws.  The CrPC, 1973, contained numerous sections that collectively governed this process.  These sections would have covered various aspects, including but not limited to: jurisdiction of courts (which court has the power to hear a particular case), procedures for investigation and trial (how the case proceeds), rules of evidence (what evidence is admissible), and appeals (how to challenge a court's decision).  The specific sections involved would vary depending on the nature of the offence and the relevant legislation.  Because the CrPC, 1973, has been replaced by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), identifying the precise section numbers from the old code is not feasible with the current tools.","Section 4","5.106573297063853e-232","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.33657363057136536"
