"Constitution","What does the territory of a country, such as India, comprise of, according to their constitutional provisions?","To the Petitioner and Respondent:  Your responses regarding Article 1(3) are partially correct, but lack crucial depth.  While Article 1(3) outlines the components of India's territory,  it raises several critical questions.  Let's delve deeper:  1. **Acquisition of Territory (Article 1(3)(c)):**  Article 1(3)(c) mentions ""such other territories as may be acquired.""  Explain the legal and constitutional processes involved in acquiring new territories.  What are the potential legal challenges, both domestically and internationally, that might arise from such acquisitions?  What role does international law play in determining the legality and validity of territorial acquisitions?  Provide specific examples, if any, of territories acquired by India after its independence and the legal framework used for their integration.  2. **First Schedule and Union Territories:** The First Schedule lists the Union Territories.  How does the inclusion or exclusion of a territory in the First Schedule affect its governance and legal status within the Indian Union?  What is the process for amending the First Schedule to include or exclude territories?  What are the implications of this process for the territorial integrity of India?  3. **Disputes over Territorial Boundaries:**  Given the complexities of border demarcation and potential disputes with neighboring countries, how does the Indian legal system address and resolve such conflicts?  What are the relevant constitutional provisions, legal mechanisms, and international treaties involved in resolving territorial disputes?  Are there any landmark Supreme Court cases that have addressed such issues?  Please cite relevant case law.  Your answers should demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the constitutional provisions, legal processes, and international legal principles governing India's territorial extent.  I expect precise and well-supported answers, demonstrating a thorough grasp of the subject matter.","The territory of a country like India comprises the territories of the States, the Union territories specified in the First Schedule, and such other territories as may be acquired.","0.035300044806441416","0.1691542268290389","0.07067137630885643","0.14925372931660108","0.652357280254364"
