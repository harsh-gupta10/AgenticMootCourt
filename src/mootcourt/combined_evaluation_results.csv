"TEST","What is India according to the Union and its Territory?","Article 1 of the Constitution of India states: ""India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.""  This establishes that India is a union of states and its territory comprises the territories of those states, as well as any other territories that may be included within the Union.  The exact extent of the territory is further detailed in the First Schedule of the Constitution, which lists the states and union territories.","India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.","0.14219205587821182","0.321428568494898","0.20512820308678503","0.321428568494898","0.6740220785140991"
"TEST","How is India, that is Bharat, defined in terms of its political structure?","India, that is Bharat, is defined in Article 1 of the Constitution as a ""Union of States.""  While this terminology suggests a federal structure, the Indian Constitution leans more towards a quasi-federal system.  The distribution of powers between the Union and the States, as outlined in the Seventh Schedule (Union List, State List, and Concurrent List), demonstrates a significant concentration of power at the Union level.  The Union government has the power to legislate on matters in the Union List, while the State governments have exclusive power over matters in the State List.  Concurrent matters fall under the jurisdiction of both.  The Supreme Court's interpretation of these provisions has further shaped the balance of power, often favoring the Union in cases of conflict.  Therefore, while nominally a Union of States, the Indian political structure is characterized by a strong central government with significant influence over the states.","India, that is Bharat, is defined as a Union of States according to the Union and its Territory.","0.06292338237590925","0.24761904503582766","0.14102563908366209","0.22857142598820862","0.7739876508712769"

The First Schedule is subject to amendment, reflecting changes in the territorial composition of India over time.","The territory of India shall comprise the territories of the States, the Union territories specified in the First Schedule, and such other territories as may be acquired.","0.18495505601743292","0.4081632604081633","0.2499999951757813","0.2857142808163266","0.7856844067573547"

"TEST","What is 'Man', 'Woman', 'Person', and 'Public' according to the Indian Penal Code?","The Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not provide explicit definitions for ""man,"" ""woman,"" ""person,"" or ""public.""  The meaning of these terms is context-dependent and determined by their usage within specific sections of the code.  Judicial interpretations over time have further shaped their understanding.  For example, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), while not directly applicable to the IPC, offers a definition of ""person"" as encompassing companies, associations, or bodies of persons, whether incorporated or not, and ""public"" as any class of the public or community.  However, even in the BNS, ""man"" and ""woman"" lack explicit definitions.  Therefore, understanding the meaning of these terms requires examining their usage within the relevant sections of the IPC and considering relevant case law.","These terms are defined in the 'General Explanations' section of the Indian Penal Code, however, the actual definitions are not provided in the provided text.","0.0261169861391665","0.1538461508598373","0.0454545425769056","0.1538461508598373","0.60085529088974"
