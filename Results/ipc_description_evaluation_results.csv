"IPC_Description","What is the full description of IPC Section b'IPC_123'?",": The process of arrest in India, governed primarily by the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and interpreted through various judicial pronouncements, involves several key steps and considerations.  1.  Information and Reasonable Suspicion: An arrest typically begins with the police receiving information about the commission of a cognizable offense. Based on this information, and if there is reasonable suspicion, the police can initiate an investigation.  2.  Warrant or Warrantless Arrest: Arrests can be made either with a warrant issued by a magistrate or without a warrant under certain circumstances specified in the CrPC (e.g., when a person has committed a cognizable offense in the presence of a police officer, or when there is a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed such an offense).  3.  Procedure for Arrest:        The police officer must inform the person being arrested of the grounds for the arrest.        The person has the right to consult with a lawyer.        The police officer must prepare an arrest memo, which should be attested by at least one witness.        The arrested person must be brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay, typically within 24 hours.  4.  Rights of the Arrested Person: The arrested person has several rights, including the right to remain silent, the right to legal representation, and the right to be examined by a medical practitioner.  5.  Use of Force: The police are allowed to use reasonable force to effect an arrest, but the force must be proportionate to the circumstances and should not be excessive.  While the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) defines offenses, the procedural aspects of arrest are mainly detailed in the CrPC. For specific provisions and the latest amendments, it is advisable to consult the CrPC directly. Additionally, you can consult legal professionals for advice tailored to specific situations.","b'Description of IPC Section 123\nAccording to section 123 of Indian penal code, Whoever, by any act, or by any illegal omission, conceals the existence of a design to wage war against the Government of India, intending by such concealment to facilitate, or knowing it to be likely that such concealment will facilitate, the waging of such war, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\nIPC 123 in Simple Words\nIf someone hides or fails to report a plan to wage war against the Government of India, intending to help or knowing it might help the war, they can be punished with imprisonment of up to ten years and may also be fined.'","3.7281808642344904e-155","0.1506276107876264","0.01617250256682346","0.13389120911398622","0.8960385322570801","IPC Section b'IPC_123'"
