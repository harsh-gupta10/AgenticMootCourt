"ArticlesConstitution","Analyze and explain the legal reasoning behind the judgment in the given case.  Case: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr., 1986 AIR 1571, 1986 SCR (2) 278",": The Supreme Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. struck down Rule 9(i) of the company's service rules, which allowed termination of permanent employees with three months' notice or pay in lieu thereof. The Court reasoned that the rule was unconscionable and violated Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act because it was against public policy. The Court emphasized the inequality of bargaining power in public sector employment and held that such arbitrary termination clauses undermine the security of tenure, which is crucial for employees to perform their duties without fear. The judgment extended the doctrine of undue influence to contracts where there is a significant power imbalance, ensuring fairness and reasonableness in contractual obligations, especially in public sector employment.","The Supreme Court in this case applied a broad interpretation of the term 'State' under Article 12 of the Constitution. The court reasoned that a government company undertaking public functions qualifies as 'State' based on factors like government control, public importance of activities etc. This interpretation was based on previous decisions that have defined 'State' under Article 12 broadly to include various agencies and instrumentalities beyond just statutory bodies. The court also applied the principle that unreasonable and arbitrary contractual terms can be struck down under Article 14 of the Constitution. The court found that Rule 9(i) of the service rules, which allowed for termination of service without reason, conferred unfettered power to terminate employment without hearing. This was deemed arbitrary and violative of principles of natural justice and right to equality under Article 14. Furthermore, the court held that the right to life and livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. The court reasoned that the right to livelihood is an integral part of the right to life, and any arbitrary action that affects a person's livelihood would be a violation of Article 21.In conclusion, the court's legal reasoning was based on a broad interpretation of the term 'State', the application of the principle of equality and natural justice under Article 14, and the protection of the right to life and livelihood under Article 21.","0.07436547027206254","0.2857142807596373","0.09836065093770514","0.2761904712358278","0.9469829797744751"

Validity of Rule 9(i): Whether Rule 9(i) of the service rules, which permits termination of employment without assigning any reason, is legally valid. 2.  Violation of Article 14: Whether Rule 9(i) is arbitrary and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. 3.  Termination Orders: Whether the termination orders issued under Rule 9(i) are legally sustainable.","The key legal issues in the case Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. are as follows: 1. The first issue is whether a government company falls under the definition of 'State' as per Article 12 of the Indian Constitution. This is important as the constitutional protections against arbitrary state action apply to 'State' entities. 2.

"ArticlesConstitution","Draft an argument appealing the decision of the given case.  Case: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr., 1986 AIR 1571, 1986 SCR (2) 278",":  Appeal Argument  Case Name: [Hypothetical Appeal Case Name]  Appellant: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd.  Respondent: Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr.  Grounds for Appeal:  1.  Misinterpretation of Public Policy: The learned judges in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. erred in their interpretation of ""public policy"" under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. The termination clause, while potentially unfavorable to the employee, did not contravene any established legal principle, statutory provision, or moral standard. The court's broad interpretation unduly expands the scope of public policy, creating uncertainty in contractual relations.  2.  Violation of Freedom of Contract: The impugned judgment infringes upon the fundamental principle of freedom of contract. Parties should be free to negotiate and agree upon terms that suit their respective interests, provided such terms are not explicitly prohibited by law. The court's intervention in this case unduly restricts the employer's ability to structure employment contracts in a manner that promotes efficiency and operational flexibility.  3.  Absence of Unequal Bargaining Power: The finding of unequal bargaining power is not supported by evidence. The employee, upon entering the employment contract, was fully aware of the terms and conditions, including the termination clause. There is no indication that the employee was coerced or unduly influenced into accepting the contract.  4.  Excessive Judicial Intervention: The court overstepped the boundaries of judicial review by interfering with a contract that did not involve any manifest illegality or violation of fundamental rights. Judicial intervention should be limited to cases where there is a clear and demonstrable breach of law or public policy, which is not the case here.  5.  Availability of Alternative Remedies: Even if the termination clause were deemed unfair, striking down the entire clause was not the appropriate remedy. The court could have instead awarded damages to the employee to compensate for any losses suffered as a result of the termination.  Prayer:  For the reasons stated above, the appellant respectfully requests that this Hon'ble Court set aside the judgment and order passed by the Supreme Court in Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. and uphold the validity of the termination clause in the employment contract.","Honorable Supreme Court, we, on behalf of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd., respectfully submit this appeal against the decision of the High Court, which declared Rule 9(i) of our service rules as arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. We humbly submit that the High Court erred in its interpretation of the Constitution and the principles of natural justice. Firstly, we contend that the High Court's broad interpretation of 'State' under Article 12 to include government companies is not in line with the constitutional intent. The framers of the Constitution intended 'State' to include only those entities which exercise governmental functions. Our corporation, although government-owned, operates in a commercial capacity and should not be subject to the same restrictions as governmental bodies. Secondly, we argue that Rule 9(i) is not arbitrary but a necessary provision for efficient management of the workforce. It allows for flexibility in employment, which is crucial for the survival and competitiveness of any commercial entity. The rule does not violate Article 14 as it applies uniformly to all employees. Furthermore, the rule does not infringe upon the right to livelihood under Article 21 as it does not prevent the terminated employees from seeking employment elsewhere. Lastly, we submit that the High Court's decision interferes with the freedom of contract, which is a fundamental principle of contract law. The employees voluntarily agreed to the terms of employment, including Rule 9(i), and it is not for the courts to interfere with such agreements. Therefore, we respectfully request the Court to set aside the decision of the High Court and uphold the validity of Rule 9(i).","0.06769038312018671","0.25824175340614064","0.0996441232421071","0.2362637314281187","0.964571475982666"

The grounds for review are limited to errors apparent on the face of the record, while a curative petition requires demonstrating a violation of natural justice and apprehension of bias. Arguing changed circumstances or subsequent legislation might also be a viable strategy. A reference to a larger bench of the Supreme Court for reconsideration is possible but highly improbable.","To challenge the decision of this case in a higher court, the following legal strategy could be adopted:1. **Reinterpretation of 'State' under Article 12**: Argue that the Supreme Court's interpretation of 'State' under Article 12 is too broad. The intention of the framers of the Constitution was to limit the definition of 'State' to government and its departments, not to extend it to government companies. This could be supported by historical and legislative intent arguments.2. **Contractual Autonomy**: Assert that the Supreme Court's decision infringes upon the autonomy of contractual relationships. The parties should be free to agree upon the terms of their contract, including termination clauses. The court's intervention in this case could set a dangerous precedent for future contractual disputes.3. **Reasonableness of Rule 9(i)**: Argue that Rule 9(i) is not arbitrary or unreasonable. It is a common clause in employment contracts that allows for flexibility in managing human resources. The rule does not automatically lead to arbitrary termination as it is subject to other legal safeguards and company policies.4. **Article 14 and Contractual Terms**: Challenge the application of Article 14 to contractual terms. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, but it does not regulate private contracts. The court's decision could lead to an unwarranted expansion of the scope of Article 14.5. **Article 21 and Right to Livelihood**: Contest the court's interpretation of the right to livelihood under Article 21. While the right to life is a fundamental right, the right to livelihood should not be interpreted in a way that restricts the ability of companies to manage their workforce effectively.6. **Precedents and Comparative Law**: Cite precedents from other jurisdictions where similar service rules have been upheld. Comparative law arguments can be used to show that the court's decision is out of step with global practices.7. **Principles of Natural Justice**: Argue that the principles of natural justice were not violated as the employees were given due notice and the opportunity to be heard before their services were terminated.This strategy would involve a comprehensive review of the judgment, identifying legal and factual errors, and presenting strong legal arguments to challenge the decision.","0.0036866197343231456","0.1710037135866006","0.048543685988901165","0.1710037135866006","0.9307758808135986"

The case revolves around the validity of service rule 9(i) allowing termination of permanent employees without assigning any reason under right to equality under Article 14. The appellant, Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd., terminated the services of the respondent employees without assigning any reason by invoking Rule 9(i) of the service rules. The respondents challenged the termination orders and the validity of Rule 9(i) by filing writ petitions in the High Court under Article 226.",": The case of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. (1986 AIR 1571, 1986 SCR (2) 278) concerns the validity of a service rule (Rule 9(i)) that allowed the employer to terminate the services of permanent employees without assigning any reason. This was challenged as a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. The employees argued that the rule was arbitrary, unreasonable, and violated principles of natural justice. The challenge was brought before the High Court under Article 226, which empowers the High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court examined whether such a rule was unconscionable and opposed to public policy, potentially rendering it void under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, which deals with unlawful agreements. The legal context, therefore, involves a conflict between contractual terms and constitutional rights, specifically the right to equality and the principles of fairness and natural justice in employment law.","The case Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. is a landmark judgment in the context of Indian constitutional and labor law. The case primarily deals with the interpretation and application of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. The case also touches upon the definition of 'State' under Article 12 of the Constitution, which includes government companies undertaking public functions. The case challenged the validity of Rule 9(i) of the service rules of the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd., which allowed the termination of permanent employees without assigning any reason. This rule was challenged as being arbitrary and violative of Article 14. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, held that such a rule is indeed arbitrary and violates the principles of natural justice and the right to equality under Article 14. The Court also held that the right to livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. The case also involved the application of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, which declares certain agreements as void if they are opposed to public policy. The Court held that Rule 9(i), being arbitrary and unreasonable, was opposed to public policy and hence void. This case thus set a precedent in Indian law by establishing that even contractual terms between State entities and private parties can be struck down if they are found to be arbitrary and violative of the right to equality under Article 14.","0.22963978227914153","0.5590551131300763","0.3263157845469529","0.5118110186418873","0.9736449718475342"

"ArticlesConstitution","Draft a summary of a given Indian law or statute, outlining its purpose, main provisions, and implications.  Case: The Constitution of India, Article 14",": Article 14 of the Constitution of India embodies the principle of equality before the law and aims to prevent discrimination. It states: ""The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."" This includes 'Equality before the law,' meaning no one is above the law, and 'Equal protection of the laws,' meaning the state must apply laws equally to those similarly situated. It allows reasonable classification, where the state can differentiate between groups if based on clear differences and rationally related to the law's objective. Article 14 is the basis for anti-discrimination laws, empowers judicial review, protects against arbitrariness, and allows reasonable restrictions for social justice. Landmark cases like Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India have reinforced its role in upholding the rule of law.","Article 14 of the Constitution of India is a fundamental right that guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. It states, 'The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.' The purpose of this Article is to ensure that every individual, irrespective of their background, is treated equally by the law. The main provisions of Article 14 are: 1) Equality before the law: This means that no person or class of persons shall be privileged over others in terms of the application of laws. 2) Equal protection of laws: This means that equals should be treated equally. This provision allows for reasonable classification but prohibits class legislation. The implications of Article 14 are far-reaching. It ensures that the State cannot discriminate against any citizen on arbitrary or unreasonable grounds. It forms the cornerstone of the rule of law, a fundamental principle of the Indian legal system. It also provides a legal remedy against discrimination and arbitrary actions of the State. However, it does not prohibit reasonable classification of persons, objects, and transactions by the law.","0.20991119225250243","0.3725490146251443","0.2033898255958634","0.3627450930565168","0.9774148464202881"

Case: The case involves the interpretation of Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 12 (Definition of State) of the Indian Constitution, and Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.",": In Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly, the Supreme Court examined the validity of a service rule that permitted the corporation to terminate the employment of permanent employees by giving them a three months' notice or salary in lieu thereof. The court held that such a clause was unconscionable and opposed to public policy, and therefore void under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The court reasoned that the corporation, being a ""State"" under Article 12 of the Constitution, could not act arbitrarily, and such a clause violated Article 14, which guarantees equality before the law. The court emphasized that the bargaining power of the corporation and its employees was unequal, leading to the inclusion of such an unfair clause in the service rules. Thus, the court used Article 14 to strike down actions by a ""State"" entity (as defined in Article 12) that were arbitrary and violated principles of fairness, and it applied Section 23 of the Contract Act to invalidate contractual terms that were against public policy.","In the case of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr., the Indian Constitution's Article 14 and Article 12, along with Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, played a crucial role. Article 14, which guarantees the right to equality, was invoked to challenge the validity of Rule 9(i) that allowed the termination of permanent employees without assigning any reason. The Supreme Court held that such a rule was arbitrary and violated the principles of natural justice and the right to equality under Article 14. The Court also held that the right to livelihood under Article 21 was affected by arbitrary termination of employment. Article 12 was interpreted to include government companies undertaking public functions as 'State'. This expanded the scope of 'State' beyond just statutory bodies to include government companies. Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, which deals with agreements opposed to public policy, was also relevant in this context. The Court held that unreasonable and arbitrary contractual terms can be struck down under Article 14.

Thorough research of subsequent case laws and exploring settlement options are also crucial.","Given the precedent set by the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. case, your legal strategy should be as follows:1. Reconsider the Termination: Given the Supreme Court's ruling in the precedent case, it would be advisable to reconsider the termination if there is no valid reason for it. If the termination is arbitrary, it is likely to be struck down by the court as violating Article 14.2. Review the Rule: Review the rule under which the termination was made. If it allows for termination without reason, consider revising it to require a valid reason for termination. This would make it less likely to be struck down as arbitrary and violative of Article 14.3. Prepare a Justification: If there is a valid reason for the termination, prepare a detailed justification. This should include evidence of the employee's misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. This will help to defend the termination in court.4. Argue for the Company's Status: While the precedent case ruled that a government company undertaking public functions qualifies as 'State' under Article 12, you could argue that your client does not fall under this definition if it does not undertake public functions or is not controlled by the government.5. Argue for the Rule's Validity: If the rule is challenged, argue for its validity. You could argue that it is necessary for the efficient operation of the company and does not violate Article 14 as it applies equally to all employees.6. Engage in Negotiation: Consider engaging in negotiation or mediation with the employee to resolve the dispute out of court. This could involve offering a fair severance package or reinstating the employee with a warning.Remember, the strategy should be tailored to the specific facts of your case and the current legal landscape.

"ArticlesConstitution","Explain the implications of the given case for future litigation.  Case: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr., 1986 AIR 1571, 1986 SCR (2) 278",":  The Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly case has significant implications for future litigation, primarily concerning contractual fairness and the judiciary's role in preventing exploitation. The key implications are as follows:  1.  Unconscionable Bargains: The case broadened the scope for courts to identify and strike down ""unconscionable bargains,"" especially in situations where there is a stark inequality of bargaining power between the parties. This means that future cases involving contracts where one party is in a dominant position will be closely scrutinized for fairness.  2.  Standard Form Contracts: The judgment has a notable impact on standard form contracts, particularly in employment. It established that courts can intervene if such contracts contain clauses that are manifestly unfair or oppressive, even if the parties have signed them. This provides a safeguard against the abuse of power by organizations with standardized contract terms.  3.  Judicial Review: The case reinforced the judiciary's power to review contractual terms to ensure they are just and equitable. This means that courts are not bound to enforce contracts strictly as written but can assess their fairness and reasonableness.  4.  Precedent for Future Cases: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly serves as a crucial precedent for future litigation involving unfair contractual terms. It provides a legal basis for challenging clauses that are one-sided, oppressive, or against public policy. This is particularly relevant in cases involving weaker parties, such as employees, consumers, or small businesses, who may be subject to unfair contract terms due to an imbalance of power.  In essence, this case empowers courts to act as guardians of fairness in contractual relationships, ensuring that dominant parties do not exploit their position through oppressive or unconscionable terms. It has become a cornerstone in Indian contract law for protecting vulnerable parties from exploitation.","The implications of the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. case for future litigation are significant. Firstly, it expanded the definition of 'State' under Article 12 of the Constitution to include government companies undertaking public functions. This means that more entities can now be held accountable for violations of fundamental rights under the Constitution. Secondly, it established that Article 14, which guarantees the right to equality, can be applied to contractual terms between State entities and private parties. This sets a precedent for challenging arbitrary and unreasonable contractual terms that violate the right to equality. Thirdly, it reinforced the principle that the right to livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. This provides a stronger basis for challenging unfair employment practices in the future. Lastly, it emphasized the importance of principles of natural justice in contractual matters, especially employment, thereby strengthening safeguards against arbitrary state action. Overall, this landmark ruling significantly expanded the scope of judicial review of state action, and set important precedents for the protection of fundamental rights in the context of employment and contractual relationships.","0.08479939798474524","0.3299663251504949","0.10714285240204502","0.30976430494847473","0.9605161547660828"

In the Indian case, the Supreme Court directly struck down a contractual clause as being against public policy due to this inequality. In the English case, the Court of Appeal focused on undue influence and the specific relationship between the parties to invalidate the agreement. While both cases aim to protect vulnerable parties from unfair agreements, the Indian judgment takes a broader approach by directly addressing the issue of unequal bargaining power and its impact on public policy, whereas the English judgment is more grounded in the specific facts and the doctrine of undue influence.","The judgment in the case of Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr. can be compared with the case of Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905) in the United States. In the Indian case, the Supreme Court struck down a service rule allowing termination of employment without reason as unconstitutional, citing violation of the right to equality under Article 14. The court held that the right to equality applies even to contractual terms between State entities and private parties if found arbitrary. This expanded the scope of 'State' under Article 12 beyond just statutory bodies to include government companies. The court also held that the right to life and livelihood under Article 21 is affected by arbitrary termination of employment. On the other hand, in the Lochner case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a New York law limiting bakery workers to a 60-hour work week, citing violation of the freedom of contract under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The court held that the law interfered with the right of contract between employers and employees. However, this judgment was later overruled and the freedom of contract doctrine was significantly limited by subsequent decisions. The Lochner era is often criticized for judicial activism and for favoring business interests over workers' rights. In contrast, the Indian case is seen as a progressive judgment that expanded the scope of judicial review of arbitrary state action and enhanced the accountability and transparency of state agencies towards citizens.","0.0812965502505995","0.2918454889277755","0.1212121166352619","0.27467810695352657","0.9599013924598694"
"ArticlesConstitution","Draft a hypothetical dissenting opinion for the provided case.  Case: Case Citation: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. vs Brojo Nath Ganguly & Anr., 1986 AIR 1571, 1986 SCR (2) 278Key Decision: Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision striking down a service rule allowing termination of employment without reason as unconstitutional.Main Issue: Validity of service rule 9(i) allowing termination of permanent employees without assigning any reason under right to equality under Article 14.Party Challenging Decision: Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd. (Appellant)Key Legal Principle: Right to equality under Article 14 applies even to contractual terms between State entities and private parties if found arbitrary.Specific Question of Law: Whether termination of employment without reason under service rule 9(i) violates right to equality under Article 14.Key Evidence: No evidence of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance was offered to justify the termination. Random selection of employees for termination violates Article 14.",":  Dissenting Opinion  I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. While I share the concern for fairness and the protection of employees from arbitrary action, I believe the majority has erred in applying Article 14 of the Constitution to invalidate a service rule that, in my view, falls within the legitimate purview of managerial discretion.  The crux of the matter is whether Rule 9(i), which allows for termination of employment by giving notice or salary in lieu thereof, is so arbitrary as to violate Article 14. The majority holds that it is, reasoning that such a rule confers unguided and uncanalized power upon the employer, leading to potential abuse. With all due respect, I find this reasoning to be an overreach of the constitutional guarantee of equality.  Firstly, it is crucial to recognize that the relationship between the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation and its employees is fundamentally contractual. While the Corporation is a State entity, the terms of employment are governed by a contract freely entered into by both parties. To interfere with such contractual terms under the guise of Article 14, absent a clear showing of mala fide intent or discriminatory application, is to unduly fetter the Corporation's ability to manage its affairs efficiently.  Secondly, the majority places great emphasis on the lack of reasons provided for the termination. However, the absence of stated reasons does not automatically equate to arbitrariness. It is conceivable that the Corporation may have valid, justifiable reasons for terminating an employee's services that, for strategic or practical considerations, it chooses not to disclose. For instance, the Corporation might be undergoing restructuring, or the employee's position may have become redundant due to technological advancements. Requiring the Corporation to disclose such reasons in every case could unduly hamper its operational flexibility and potentially lead to protracted litigation.  Thirdly, the majority's reliance on the principle of natural justice is, in my view, misplaced. While natural justice requires fairness in decision-making, it does not mandate that every employment termination be preceded by a full-fledged inquiry. The requirement of notice or salary in lieu thereof, as provided in Rule 9(i), serves as a reasonable safeguard against arbitrary action. It provides the employee with an opportunity to seek alternative employment and mitigates the financial hardship caused by the termination.  Finally, I am mindful of the potential consequences of the majority's decision. By invalidating Rule 9(i), the Court has opened the door to a flood of litigation challenging employment terminations. This will not only burden the courts but also create uncertainty and instability in the employment sector. Employers, particularly State entities, will be hesitant to take necessary disciplinary actions or implement restructuring plans for fear of legal challenges.  In conclusion, while I am sympathetic to the plight of employees who are terminated without reason, I believe that the majority's decision is an unwarranted intrusion into the realm of contractual freedom and managerial discretion. I would have upheld the validity of Rule 9(i), subject to the caveat that it must be exercised in good faith and without discriminatory intent. The remedy for potential abuse lies not in striking down the rule altogether, but in ensuring that it is applied fairly and transparently.","""While I respect the majority's decision, I write separately to express my dissent. The majority's decision, in my view, unduly expands the scope of Article 14 and interferes with the contractual freedom of parties. Firstly, the majority's interpretation of 'State' under Article 12 is overly broad. The Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd., although a government company, operates in a commercial sphere and should not be subject to the same constitutional constraints as traditional state entities. This expansion of the definition of 'State' could have far-reaching implications for the functioning of government companies. Secondly, the majority's application of Article 14 to contractual terms between parties is problematic. While the Constitution guarantees the right to equality, it does not guarantee the right to employment. The service rule 9(i) is a contractual term agreed upon by the parties. The rule does not discriminate between employees but applies uniformly to all. The fact that the rule allows for termination without reason does not make it arbitrary or unreasonable. It is a common feature in employment contracts to allow for flexibility in managing human resources. Lastly, the majority's reliance on Article 21 to strike down the service rule is misplaced. The right to livelihood does not mean that an employee has an absolute right to his job. The right to livelihood cannot be used to curtail the employer's right to terminate employment as per the agreed terms. In conclusion, while I empathize with the employees who lost their jobs, I believe the majority's decision unduly interferes with the contractual freedom of parties and expands the scope of constitutional protections in a manner not envisaged by the Constitution-makers.""","0.09841074724599444","0.3348623807793957","0.10425239612269302","0.3165137569261847","0.9761883020401001"
