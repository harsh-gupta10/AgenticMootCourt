"LawyerGPT","Can you summarize the main arguments of the Supreme Court of India judgment in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala?","The Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973) case primarily revolved around the scope of Parliament's power to amend the Constitution under Article 368.     Petitioners' Argument: Argued that the amending power was not absolute and could not be used to destroy the Constitution's fundamental features or ""basic structure,"" including Fundamental Rights. They stressed constitutional supremacy.    Respondents' Argument (Government): Contended that Parliament had unlimited power under Article 368 to amend any part of the Constitution, including abrogating Fundamental Rights, reflecting parliamentary sovereignty in amending matters.    Supreme Court's Ruling: The Court held that Parliament's amending power is wide but not unlimited. It cannot be exercised in a way that alters or destroys the ""basic structure"" or fundamental framework of the Constitution. While upholding Parliament's right to amend Fundamental Rights (overruling Golaknath), it subjected this power to the condition that the core constitutional identity must remain intact. This judgment established the crucial Basic Structure Doctrine in Indian constitutional law.","In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, the Supreme Court ruled that the basic structure of the Constitution, including inviolable fundamental rights, cannot be altered by the Parliament.","0.06445573891424113","0.2325581365062196","0.10465116014399682","0.20155038456823512","0.9116662740707397"
