"IPC","What does the Indian Penal Code say about the impact of this Act on certain laws?","Section 5 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, addresses the Act's impact on certain other laws. It states that nothing in the IPC shall affect the provisions of: 1.  Any Act specifically dealing with the punishment of mutiny and desertion of officers, soldiers, sailors, or airmen in the service of the Government of India. 2.  Any special law (a law applicable to a particular subject). 3.  Any local law (a law applicable only to a particular part of India).  This means the IPC generally does not override these specific categories of laws, allowing them to operate concurrently or independently as applicable.","The Indian Penal Code specifies that certain laws are not to be affected by this Act.","0.025005019608479232","0.17977527794975384","0.01869158637435615","0.17977527794975384","0.8616749048233032"
