"CRPC","What is the purpose of Section 3 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973?","Section 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, serves as an interpretation clause. Its purpose is to clarify how references to different classes of Magistrates (like ""Magistrate of the first class"" or ""Presidency Magistrate"") mentioned in laws enacted before the CrPC, 1973, should be construed or understood in the context of the judicial hierarchy established by the 1973 Code, particularly distinguishing between metropolitan and other areas. This ensures older laws are applied correctly under the current structure.","Construction of references","6.995501686664742e-232","0.06060605973829202","0.0","0.06060605973829202","0.551443338394165"
"CRPC","What is regulated under Section 4 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973?","Section 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) regulates the trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other laws.  1.  Section 4(1) specifies that all offences under the Indian Penal Code must be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with according to the procedures laid down in the CrPC. 2.  Section 4(2) extends this principle to offences under any other law (special or local laws). It states that these offences shall also be dealt with according to CrPC procedures, unless that other law contains specific provisions regulating the manner or place of investigation, inquiry, trial, etc., for those offences. In such cases, the specific provisions of the special or local law will apply.  In essence, Section 4 establishes the CrPC as the primary procedural law for criminal offences in India, while acknowledging that specific statutes may provide for different procedures for offences defined within them.","Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws","0.042743470518837645","0.1923076904160503","0.10958903981985363","0.1923076904160503","0.7757549285888672"
