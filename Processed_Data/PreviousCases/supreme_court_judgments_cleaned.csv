1,24-08-2017,JUSTICE K.S.PUTTASWAMY(RETD) vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 494/2012,Recognition of the right to privacy as part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and other rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution,"JUSTICE K.S.PUTTASWAMY(RETD) V. UNION OF INDIA2017 INSC 801 (24 August 2017)Justices:  Chief Justice Jagdish S. Khehar, Justice Jasti Chelameswar, Justice Sharad A. Bobde, Justice Rajesh K. Agrawal, Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, Justice Abhay M. Sapre, Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Syed A. NazeerQuestion(s):  Is the right to privacy a part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and other rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution? Factual Background:  The Union of India, through the adoption of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 and the Aadhar card scheme, sought to collect demographic and biometric data of individuals to reduce leakages in the distribution of various public benefits. These measures were challenged before a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court on the ground that the data collection violated individual’s right to privacy. Considering the pronouncements in M.P. Sharma v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate (Eight-Judge Bench) (“M.P. Sharma”) (1954 INSC 24) and Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (Six-Judge Bench) (“Kharak Singh”) (1962 INSC 389) where the Court observed that the right to privacy is not protected under our Constitution, the Three-Judge Bench referred the matter to the Constitution Bench (Five Judges).The observation made in M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh were based on the judgment of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (“A. K. Gopalan”) (1950 INSC 13), which was held to be incorrect by the Supreme Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India (Eleven-Judge Bench) (“R. C. Cooper”) (1970 INSC 18). Further, in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (Seven-Judge Bench) (“Maneka Gandhi”) (1978 INSC 16), the majority view in Kharak Singh was overruled. However, since the decisions of a larger bench (M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh) cannot be ignored by a smaller Bench, the present Constitution Bench placed the question before a Nine-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Nine-Judge Bench wrote five opinions. All nine judges unanimously upheld the right to privacy as a part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution, and a protected right across the fundamental freedoms guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights). The Supreme Court held that privacy is inherent and inseparable from dignified human existence. A majority of judges agreed that an individual's privacy can only be interfered with by a measure based on a law, is necessary to secure a legitimate government interest, and the interference with privacy is proportionate to the government’s objective. Justice Chandrachud authored a plurality opinion on behalf of Chief Justice Khehar, Justice Agrawal, Justice Nazeer, and himself. Justice Chelameswar, Justice Bobde, Justice Nariman, Justice Kaul, and Justice Sapre all authored separate concurring opinions.Reasons for the Decision:  The decisions in M.P. Sharma and Kharak SinghThe decisions in M. P. Sharma and Kharak Singh were based on the view of the majority in A. K. Gopalan, which was later overruled in R. C. Cooper and Maneka Gandhi (¶24 J. Chandrachud, ¶7 J. Bobde). A. K. Gopalan treated each article in Part III of the Constitution as embodying distinct, non-overlapping freedoms (¶13 J. Chandrachud). Consequently, the decisions of M. P. Sharma and Kharak Singh did not recognize the interconnected nature of fundamental rights, meaning they should not be read in isolation. However, in R. C. Cooper, the Court rejected the notion that fundamental rights operate in watertight compartments (¶¶21,150 J. Chandrachud). Therefore, the judgments in M. P. Sharma and Kharak Singh cannot impede the interpretation of the fundamental right to privacy within Part III of the Constitution (¶¶19-24 J. Chandrachud, ¶7 J. Chelameswar, ¶7 J. Bobde, ¶¶35-38 J. Nariman).In M.P. Sharma, the Supreme Court refused to read the right to privacy as part of the right against self-incrimination in Article 20(3) of the Constitution (¶26 J. Chandrachud, ¶7 J. Chelameswar, ¶4 J. Bobde). However, the Court in M.P. Sharma refrained from making any observations regarding the import of the fundamental right to privacy under Part III of the Constitution. The Supreme Court in the present case found that M.P. Sharma dealt only with Article 20(3) and not with other fundamental rights (¶¶26,185 J. Chandrachud, ¶7 J. Chelameswar, ¶¶4, 7-9 J. Bobde, ¶¶25-27 J. Nariman). Hence, the judgment of M.P. Sharma does not fall in the way of reading the right to privacy in Part III of the Constitution (¶¶ 25-26,185 J. Chandrachud, ¶7 J. Chelameswar, ¶¶7-9 J. Bobde, ¶¶25-27 J. Nariman).The Supreme Court held that the majority in Kharak Singh was accurate in stating that Article 21 assures that dignity is essential for the development and evolution of a human being. However, it was not correct to hold that the right to privacy is not part of our Constitution (¶89 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Chelameswar, ¶6 J. Bobde, ¶42 J. Nariman). The decision in Kharak Singh was overruled to this extent.The judgments of Govind v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1975 INSC 74), R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu (1994 INSC 455), and People’s Union of Civil Liberties v. Union of India (1996 INSC 1509), have affirmed the right to privacy as a constitutionally protected right under Article 21. Through Selvi v. State of Karnataka (2007 INSC 520), the Court had recognized constitutional protection to privacy in physical as well as mental sense (¶61 J. Chandrachud, ¶10 J. Bobde, ¶75 J. Nariman).Affirmation of the Constituent Assembly is not a necessityThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that whatever is not found in the text of the Constitution cannot become part of the Constitution ( ¶17 J. Chelameswar). It held that it cannot be conclusively stated from the Constituent Assembly debates that the Constituent Assembly rejected the existence of the right to privacy (¶148 J. Chandrachud, ¶17 J. Chelameswar). The relevance of the Constituent Assembly debates may be limited as the right to privacy must be assessed within the contemporary context (¶151 J. Chandrachud, ¶44 J. Nariman, ¶31 J. Kaul).Privacy is a facet of Article 21The Supreme Court disagreed with the respondents that there is no concept of ‘privacy.’ The Court held that the mere absence of the definition of ‘privacy’ cannot prevent the Court from recognizing the right of privacy and its contours. (¶¶48-50 J. Nariman, ¶¶19-21 J. Bobde, ¶10 J. Kaul). The Court held that privacy is the foundational condition for exercising the right to life and personal liberty (¶24 J. Bobde, ¶91 J. Chandrachud). Dignity, which lies at the heart of the Constitution and is expressly recognized in the Preamble and Article 21, cannot be safeguarded without privacy. The framers of the Constitution envisioned a society where liberty and dignity are central to the fulfilment of constitutional values (¶107 J. Chandrachud). Privacy, as a core value intertwined with life and liberty, ensures that dignity is upheld (¶107 J. Chandrachud, ¶¶25-30 J. Bobde, ¶48 J. Nariman, ¶40 J. Kaul).The Supreme Court stated that the right to privacy includes the preservation of personal intimacies, sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, and sexual orientation (¶169 J. Chandrachud). Justice Chelameswar opined that the right to privacy consists of three facets i.e., repose (freedom from unwarranted stimuli), sanctuary (protection against intrusive observation), and intimate decision-making (autonomy over personal choices) (¶36 J. Chelameswar). Justice Nariman also highlighted that privacy rights extend beyond a person’s body to informational privacy. He emphasised that individuals have the right to control the dissemination of personal information, and any unauthorised use of such material may result in an infringement of this right (i.e., informational privacy) (¶81, J. Nariman, ¶177 J. Chandrachud, ¶11, J. Kaul).Statutory protection cannot deny constitutional protectionThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that since various statutory laws acknowledge the right to privacy, declaring it as a fundamental right in Part III is not required. The Court held that constitutional rights are not subject to the whims of a particular government. Unlike a statutory right, a constitutional right cannot be modified, annulled, or curtailed by the legislative majority (¶153 J. Chandrachud, ¶19 J. Chelameswar, ¶39 J. Bobde).Restriction on the rightThe Supreme Court held that the right to privacy is not absolute; it is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by the State to protect legitimate State interests (¶43 J. Chelameswar, ¶86 J. Nariman, ¶72 J. Kaul). The Court held that all limitations on privacy are subject to three requirements derived from Article 21. First, there must exist a validly enacted law that authorises the infringement of privacy. Second, the infringement must be necessary to meet a legitimate aim. Third, the means or methods of the State must be proportionate to the government’s legitimate aim (¶180 J. Chandrachud). Justice Kaul also held that there should be procedural safeguards against the infringement of the right (¶71 J. Kaul).Prepared by Sakshi Komal Dubey (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

2,09-05-2017,IN RE vs HONBLE MR JUSTICE C.S. KARNANSMC(C) No. 1/2017,Contempt proceedings against Justice C.S. Karnan.,"IN RE V. HONBLE MR JUSTICE C.S. KARNAN2017 INSC 455 (9 May 2017)Justices:  Chief Justice Jagdish S. Khehar, Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Jasti Chelameswar, Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Madan B. Lokur, Justice Pinaki C. Ghose, and Justice Kurian JosephQuestion(s):  Whether Justice Chinnaswamy S. Karnan (Judge of the High Court of Madras, and High Court of Calcutta) is guilty of contempt of Court.Factual Background:  In 2015, while Justice Karnan was a sitting judge of the Madras High Court, he had levelled a series of corruption allegations against various judges of the Madras High Court. He sent letters to the highest executive and judicial authorities alleging that the academic certificates of a newly appointed judge were fake and accusing two other judges of not acting independently. Additionally, he accused the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court of discriminating against him, and claimed he was subjected to ragging and ridicule by fellow Madras High Court judges due to his caste. Justice Karnan also initiated suo-motu writ proceedings, during which he stayed administrative orders passed by the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court. On 12 February 2016, Justice Karnan was transferred to the Calcutta High Court.A Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court consisting of the seven senior most judges initiated suo-motu contempt proceedings against Justice Karnan on 8 February 2017 in light of his public allegations against numerous judges and the issuance of orders without legal sanction or justification.Despite receiving a contempt notice from the Supreme Court, Justice Karnan continued to pass orders in suo-motu proceedings, including staying orders passed by the Supreme Court. In one instance, he wrote a letter demanding that the seven Supreme Court judges presiding over the contempt proceedings against him pay a sum of ?14 crores as compensation, alleging that they had disturbed his peace of mind, disrupted his normal life, and insulted him publicly due to their purported lack of legal knowledge. Furthermore, Justice Karnan ordered the registration of a case under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (“SC/ST Act”), against all seven members of the Bench. He even issued an order restraining the judges from travelling abroad and sentenced them to five years of imprisonment under the SC/ST Act.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court found Justice Karnan guilty of contempt, sentenced him to six months imprisonment, and held that his allegations against various judges and the judiciary in general were malicious and defamatory. The Court held that the conduct of Justice Karnan constituted criminal contempt, which both scandalised the court and interfered with the administration of justice.The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Khehar. Justice Chelameswar wrote a separate concurring judgment for himself and Justice Gogoi.Reasons for the Decision:  Allegations levelled by Justice Karnan were not supported by any materialThe Supreme Court held that the allegations which were levelled by Justice Karnan against various judges were not supported by any material and that his allegations were defamatory (¶35).Justice Chelameswar further held that Justice Karnan was in the habit of making vague and incoherent allegations against his colleagues and Chief Justices of the Madras High Court (¶5, J. Chelameswar).The Supreme Court found that Justice Karnan’s various letters contained scandalous accusations against Judges of High Courts and the Supreme Court. These letters were directed to the highest constitutional authorities across the branches of governance, ridiculing the judiciary (¶33).Justice Chelameswar noted that Justice Karnan regularly wrote letters to various judicial and executive authorities, alleging corruption and commission of offences by Judges and Chief Justices of the Madras High Court (¶3, J. Chelameswar). He held that Justice Karnan’s frequent and serious allegations against his colleagues, which were made public, undoubtedly tarnished the reputation of targeted judges and the Madras High Court, thereby undermining the credibility of the judiciary (¶10, J. Chelameswar).No person can judge a case in which they have an interestJustice Chelameswar held that Justice Karnan seemed unaware of a fundamental legal principle: a complainant cannot be a judge in their own complaint. He observed that on multiple occasions, Justice Karnan issued orders, supposedly as part of his judicial duties, instructing state authorities to take legal action against judges of the Madras High Court based on his own allegations (¶8, J. Chelameswar).Conduct of Justice Karnan after initiation of suo-motu contempt proceedings against himThe Supreme Court observed that during the hearing of contempt proceedings, Justice Karnan’s ridicule of the Supreme Court persisted and even intensified, with him going so far as to defy court orders (¶35).Justice Chelameswar noted that Justice Karnan accused the Supreme Court Bench of bias against him and asserted that the contempt proceedings were both malicious and violated the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 since Justice Karnan belonged to the Dalit caste (¶14, J. Chelameswar). Justice Chelameswar further held that Justice Karnan’s conduct in passing various orders post initiation of suo-motu proceedings left no doubt that he interfered with the judicial proceedings of the Supreme Court (¶25, J. Chelameswar). He held that such conduct undermines public confidence in the judicial system. It was also observed that Justice Karnan did not show any sign of remorse, which could have been a mitigating factor (¶25, J. Chelameswar).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,27-09-2018,JOSEPH SHINE vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017,Section 497 IPC (Adultery) struck down as unconstitutional,"JOSEPH SHINE V. UNION OF INDIA2018 INSC 898 (27 September 2018)Justices:   Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Rohinton F Nariman, Justice Ajay M Khanwilkar, Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Justice Indu Malhotra Question(s):   (i) Whether Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (“IPC”), which criminalises adultery violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. (ii) Whether Section 198(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“CrPC”), which only allowed a husband to complain of adultery, violates Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. (iii) Whether Section 497 IPC should be made gender neutral by including women as offenders.Factual Background:   Section 497 of the IPC made it unlawful for a man to have sexual intercourse with a woman who he knew, or had reason to believe, was the wife of another man, without the consent of the second man. This was termed as the offence of adultery. Under Section 198(2) CrPC, only the second man (husband) is recognized as the victim, granting him sole authority to file a complaint. The wife is not seen as an offender; rather, criminal liability falls solely on the first man having intercourse with the married womanThe Petitioners filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India challenging the constitutionality of Section 497 of IPC and Section 198(2) of CrPC. The Petitioners contended that Section 497 conceives of the wife as the property of her husband and deprives her of sexual autonomy. The Petitioners pointed out that this law was enacted during the colonial era and has no relevance in the modern times. The Petitioners also contended that the sexual intercourse between two persons amounting to adultery is consensual and therefore, if adultery was criminalised, both parties should be punished equally.The Union of India contended that adultery is behaviour which, if not criminalised, affects the sanctity of the marital union and society as a whole. The Union of India also argued that Article 15(3) of the Constitution allows the Government to enact special protections for women and children to protect and uplift this section of society.Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court unanimously struck down Section 497 of IPC as unconstitutional because it violated the principles of equality, gender discrimination, and personal autonomy under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court also held that Section 198(2) of the CrPC was unconstitutional when read with Section 497 of the IPC. Chief Justice Misra authored a plurality opinion (on behalf of Justice Khanwilkar and himself), while Justice Nariman, Justice Chandrachud, and Justice Malhotra wrote separate but concurring opinions. Reasons for the Decision:   Violates the right to equality under Article 14The Supreme Court stated that societal norms evolve over time, indicating that what was deemed acceptable in the past may not hold true today (¶3 J. Misra). The Court observed that at the time the IPC was drafted, men exercised significant social control over women (¶22 J. Misra, ¶12 J. Malhotra). The Court found that in today’s society, Section 497 of IPC degrades the status of women and treats them as property of their husbands (¶25 J. Misra, ¶26 J. Nariman, ¶36 J. Chandrachud, ¶12 J. Malhotra).Article 15 of the Constitution of India prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex. The Supreme Court held that Section 497 of IPC and Section 198(2) of the CrPC discriminate against women on the grounds of sex as they do not give women the right to prosecute their adulterous husbands or the woman with whom their husbands committed adultery, and therefore, violate Article 14 and 15(1) of Constitution of India (¶25 J. Misra).Does not protect womenThe Supreme Court observed that Article 15(3) of the Constitution allows the State to enact laws for the protection and advancement of women and children, aimed at promoting equality and addressing historical disadvantages. However, Section 497 did not fulfil this purpose. Instead, it perpetuated inequality and reinforced gender stereotypes by depriving women of the right to prosecute and treating them as the property of their husbands. Therefore, Section 497 cannot be justified or protected under Article 15(3) (¶¶40-41, ¶48 J. Chandrachud, ¶14 J. Malhotra). Violates privacy and dignity of women under Article 21 of the Constitution The Supreme Court held that Article 21 of Constitution of India guarantees to citizens privacy and sexual autonomy. The Court observed that adultery is a personal matter within the private domain of an individual and the relationship between two consenting adults. Criminalising adultery would intrude upon the private sphere of marital relationships. The State should not interfere in individuals' private lives unless there is a compelling public interest (¶49 J. Misra, ¶15 J. Malhotra).Adultery cannot be a criminal offenceThe Supreme Court held that adultery deals with private and consensual relationships between men and women and therefore it does not come under the realm of criminal offence though it can be considered a moral offence (¶49 J. Misra, ¶16 J. Malhotra).Prepared by Hiteshi Sharma (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

2,26-09-2018,JARNAIL SINGH  vs LACHHMI NARAIN GUPTA .C.A. No. 629/2022,Constitutionality of requiring quantifiable data to determine backwardness of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and applicability of 'creamy layer' doctrine to SCs and STs.,"JARNAIL SINGH  V. LACHHMI NARAIN GUPTA .2018 INSC 881 (26 September 2018)Justices:  Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice R.F. Nariman, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Justice Indu Malhotra.Question(s):  (i) Whether the correctness of the Constitution Bench (Five Judges) decision in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006 INSC 711), (“Nagaraj”) should be reconsidered by a Seven-Judge Bench. (ii) Whether the requirement in Nagaraj that quantifiable data concerning the backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (“SCs and STs”) should be collected prior to granting reservation is valid. (iii) Whether the doctrine of ‘creamy layer’ is applicable to the SCs and STs for the purposes of promotions in public employment.Factual Background:  This case emanated from two reference orders passed by a Division Bench (Two-Judge) of the Supreme Court (State of Tripura v. Jayanta Chakraborty, 2017 INSC 1113) (“Jayanta Chakraborty”) and a Three-Judge Bench (State of Maharashtra v. Vijay Ghogre, (2018) 17 SCC 261) (“Vijay Ghogre”). The questions posed in these cases involved the interpretation of Articles 16(4), 16(4A) and 16(4B) of the Constitution of India against the backdrop of two previous decisions of the Supreme Court — Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (“Indra Sawhney”) (1996 INSC 1273), a decision by nine judges, and Nagaraj, a decision by five judges.The Supreme Court in Jayanta Chakraborty found that a question of further and finer interpretation on the application of Article 16(4A) has arisen and referred it to a Constitution Bench. Subsequently, in Vijay Ghogre, the Court without going into the merits of Jayanta Chakraborty i.e. whether a Two-Judge Bench could directly refer a matter to a larger Bench under Article 145(3) of the Constitution of India when there is already a decision of Constitution Bench, found it appropriate to refer the issue to a Constitution Bench to determine whether Nagaraj requires reconsideration.In Nagaraj, a 2006 Constitution Bench decision had upheld the constitutional validity of the constitutional amendments which had introduced Article 16(4A) and 16(4B) into the Constitution of India. These amendments provided reservation in promotions for SC and ST employees and the carrying forward of unfilled SC and ST posts.The Supreme Court in Nagraj noted that the State is not bound to make reservations for SCs and STs in matters of promotion. However, if it chooses to do so, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing the backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment The State must also comply with Article 335 of the Constitution of India which provides for the maintenance of efficiency in administration while considering the claims of SCs, and STs to appointments in public sector posts. The Constitution Bench in Nagraj also held that the ‘creamy layer’ doctrine, which excludes socially and educationally advanced members of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from getting reservation based on income-wealth criteria, was also applicable to the SCs and STs.In the present case, the Union of India India argued that both these findings were incorrect, as they were contrary to the Nine-Judge Bench decision in Indra Sawhney.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court declined to refer the correctness of Nagraj to a Seven-Judge-Bench. The Court held that the declaration in Nagraj that quantifiable data should be collected for the purposes of determining backwardness and inadequacy of representation of SC and ST classes is contrary to the Nine-Judge-Bench decision in Indra Sawhney and hence incorrect. The Court also ruled that the doctrine of ‘creamy layer’ is applicable to reservations for SCs and STs and courts could themselves exclude the creamy layer from reservations. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Nariman.Reasons for the Decision:  Collection of quantifiable data contrary to Indra SawhneyThe Supreme Court found that the declaration in Nagaraj that the State has to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the SCs and STs is contrary to the judgment of the Nine-Judge-Bench in Indra Sawhney. In Indra Sawhney, it was held that the test of social and educational backwardness cannot be applied to SCs and STs, who unquestionably fall within the category of backward class of citizens deserving of reservation. This is in part because SCs and STs are identified by Presidential notifications under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution, and such notifications are themselves based on socio-economic exclusion (¶14). Therefore, it would be improper to require reservations for SCs and STs to be based on quantifiable data.Applicability of the creamy layer doctrine to SC and SC reservations permissibleThe Supreme Court also held that although Indra Sawhney did not rule on the applicability of creamy layer doctrine to SCs and STs, the doctrine was always a facet of constitutional equality located in Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution of India (¶¶8,15). This is because equality will not be served if a creamy layer of elites with a subjugated group capture the benefits of reservation (¶15). The Court thus ruled that the creamy layer could be excluded from reservations even in the case of SCs and STs (¶15). Further, the Court ruled that the courts exclusion of the creamy layer of SCs and STs from reservations does not amount to an interference with the President’s power to identify and designate SCs and STs under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution (¶15).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

3,26-09-2018,SWAPNIL TRIPATHI vs SUPREME COURT OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 1232/2017,Plea seeking live streaming of court proceedings and the Supreme Court's guidelines.,"SWAPNIL TRIPATHI V. SUPREME COURT OF INDIA2018 INSC 886 (26 September 2018)Justices:  Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Ajay M. Khanwilkar, Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. ChandrachudQuestion(s):  Whether live-streaming of proceedings at the Supreme Court should be permitted to facilitate increased access to justice and further the principle of open courts.Factual Background:  The Petitioners approached the Supreme Court under Article 32 and sought a declaration permitting live streaming of Supreme Court proceedings in cases of constitutional or national importance. They argued that people are unable to witness Supreme Court proceedings in person due to constraints on time, resources, and geographic accessibility. The Petitioners submitted that live streaming of such proceedings should be permitted to enhance transparency, foster public confidence in the judiciary, and reduce misinformation about the judicial process.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court allowed the petition and held that live streaming of court proceedings should be introduced as a pilot project for cases of constitutional and national importance being heard by the Chief Justice of India. The Court found that live streaming would be an extension of the principle of open courts and access to justice, which will serve diverse stakeholders and the public at large. Justice Khanwilkar authored the majority opinion on behalf of himself and Chief Justice Misra, while Justice Chandrachud authored a separate concurring opinion.The Supreme Court issued model guidelines for live streaming of court proceedings, initially to be implemented at the Supreme Court. The guidelines aimed to balance the principle of open courts with the dignity of court proceedings and the privacy interests of litigants and witnesses.Justice Chandrachud recommended the adoption of live streaming in High Courts and district courts in a phased manner based on the available resources and technical support. The Chief Justices of the High Courts were advised to frame appropriate rules for this purpose, taking into account the model guidelines suggested by the Supreme Court.Reasons for the Decision:  Open justice as a check on the judiciaryThe Supreme Court opined that open justice is a long-established principle of common law systems that serves as a check on judicial arbitrariness and builds public confidence in the administration of justice (¶3, J. Khanwilkar; ¶¶6, 9, J. Chandrachud). Justice Chandrachud held that live streaming of court proceedings is an extension of this principle, enabling the public to have virtual access to courtrooms (¶¶17, 18(d), J. Chandrachud). He stated that ‘sunlight was the best disinfectant’, and live streaming proceedings, as an extension of the principle of open courts, would result in greater transparency and accountability in the judicial process (¶18(h), J. Chandrachud).Justice Chandrachud noted that the impact of open courts in India is diminished by the fact that a large segment of society rarely has the opportunity to attend court proceedings due to constraints like poverty, illiteracy, distance, and lack of awareness (¶13, J. Chandrachud). The Supreme Court observed that live streaming has the potential to reach a wide audience and will open up the judicial system to those outside the courtroom (¶18(d), J. Chandrachud, ¶9, J. Khanwilkar).Reducing reliance on second-hand narratives and misinformationJustice Chandrachud observed that live streaming will reduce the public's reliance on second-hand accounts to obtain information about important cases (¶18(c), J. Chandrachud). It will enable the public to view court proceedings first-hand and form reasoned and educated opinions about the functioning of courts, thereby reducing misinformation and misunderstanding about judicial proceedings (¶4, J. Khanwilkar, ¶ 18(c), J. Chandrachud).International practices on live streaming of court proceedingsReferencing practices adopted in jurisdictions like Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, South Africa, the UK, and the USA, where live streaming of court proceedings is already permitted, Justice Chandrachud noted that broadcasting of courtroom proceedings has emerged through judicial decisions in several countries (¶¶19-20, J. Chandrachud). Most jurisdictions follow certain common practices such as minimal delay in live broadcast, retention of copyright with the court, conducting pilot projects, and excluding certain sensitive cases from broadcast (¶20, J. Chandrachud).Balancing open justice with the dignity and majesty of court proceedingsThe Supreme Court acknowledged the need to balance the principle of open justice with preserving the dignity of court proceedings. The model guidelines framed by the Court aimed to address this balance by excluding certain sensitive cases from live streaming, granting the presiding judge the discretion to disallow live streaming, ensuring that live streaming is carried out with a delay of two minutes, prohibiting unauthorised usage of live streamed content, and archiving the audio-visual recordings of the proceedings (¶26, J. Chandrachud, ¶¶13-14, J. Khanwilkar).Authority to frame rules and modalities for live streamingThe Supreme Court clarified that the model guidelines will not detract from the Court's authority to frame rules under Article 145(1) of the Constitution to determine the modalities of live streaming (¶14, J. Khanwilkar, ¶26, J. Chandrachud). Justice Chandrachud recommended introducing live streaming initially as a pilot project in the Chief Justice of India’s court, to be expanded gradually to other courts based on the experience gained during the pilot (¶25, J. Chandrachud).Importance of live streaming for access to justice in lower courtsHighlighting the importance of access to justice, Justice Chandrachud observed that the need for live streaming of proceedings applies with greater force to cases in the district judiciary and the High Courts, as they represent the first interface of the ordinary citizen with the judicial system (¶22, J. Chandrachud).

4,25-09-2018,PUBLIC INTEREST FOUNDATION  vs UNION OF INDIA W.P.(C) No. 536/2011,Can there be any additional grounds for disqualification from the membership of Parliament/State Legislature other than Article 102 and Representation of Peoples Act 1951,"PUBLIC INTEREST FOUNDATION  V. UNION OF INDIA 2018 INSC 862 (25 September 2018)Justices:   Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, Justice Ajay M. Khanwilkar, Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Indu MalhotraQuestion(s):   Whether any additional grounds for disqualification from the membership of Parliament/State Legislature can be laid down by the Supreme Court beyond Article 102(a) to (d) and the Representation of Peoples Act 1951.Factual Background:   In 2011, the Public Interest Foundation filed a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution highlighting the criminalisation of politics. The petitioner requested the Supreme Court to expand the grounds for disqualification of membership in Parliament/State Legislature to disqualify candidates and legislators having serious criminal charges framed against them by a court. It was also requested by the petitioner that the candidates facing charges for heinous offences should be barred from contesting on any political party’s symbol. After hearing initial arguments, the Court requested the Law Commission to submit a report on the criminalisation of politics. In 2014, the 244th Report of the Law Commission was submitted which suggested that the framing of charges should be made a ground for disqualification of membership of the  Parliament/State Legislature. Subsequently, the Three-Judge Bench referred the matter to be heard by a Constitution Bench. On 25th September 2018, the Constitution Bench (five-judges) delivered a unanimous verdict on the issue wherein it declined to add any further ground for disqualification of membership of Parliament/State Legislature.Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Constitution Bench (five-judges) unanimously held that it could not alter grounds for disqualification as that would amount to law-making which was exclusively a legislative function. It further decided against empowering the Election Commission of India to remove a party’s symbol if it fielded candidates having serious criminal record.The Court amid rising criminalisation of politics emphasised on the importance of an informed electorate in safeguarding India’s democracy and issued the following directions: Each contesting candidate shall fill up the form as provided by the Election Commission and  the form must contain all the particulars as required therein. It shall state, in bold letters, with regard to the criminal cases pending against the candidate. If a candidate is contesting an election on the ticket of a particular party, he/she is required to  inform the party about the criminal cases pending against him/her.The concerned political party shall be obligated to put up on its website the aforesaid  information pertaining to candidates having criminal antecedents. The candidate as well as the concerned political party shall issue a declaration in the widely circulated newspapers in the locality about the antecedents of the candidate and also give wide publicity in the electronic media. The judgement was authored by Chief Justice Misra.Reasons for the Decision:   Separation of PowersThe Supreme Court observed that a reading of Article 102 and 199 of the Constitution establishes that the power to enact laws regarding disqualification of a member of Parliament/State Legislature vested exclusively with the legislative (¶7). Since the language employed by the legislative under Sections 7-10 of the Representation of Peoples Act 1951 is clear and unambiguous, the Court cannot legislate or add new grounds for disqualification. The legislature has clearly enumerated the grounds for disqualification and the language of the said provision leaves no room for any new ground to be added or introduced (¶¶22-23).The Court further observed that in cases where a particular symbol has been reserved for a political party, and that party has fielded a candidate who has been charged for heinous and/or grievous offenses, directing the Election Commission to prohibit such a candidate from contesting with the reserved symbol for the political party would amount to indirectly adding a new ground for disqualification. This would be a colourable exercise of judicial power, as it is axiomatic that ""what cannot be done directly ought not to be done indirectly,"" which is a well-settled principle in the Indian judiciary (¶98).Right of the electorate to know about the candidates contesting in elections. The Court underscored that the rising criminalisation of politics could potentially destabilise  the democratic structure of India and emphasised on the need for creating a strong legal framework, mandating political parties to revoke the membership of individuals against whom charges have been framed for heinous and grievous offenses and prohibiting such individuals from being fielded as candidates in elections for Parliament/State Assemblies. The Court observed that such measures would go a long way in realising the electorate’s right to know about their candidates achieving the decriminalisation of politics and ushering in an era of immaculate, spotless, unsullied, and virtuous constitutional democracy (¶¶106-109).Prepared By Raza Haider ZaidiCentre for Research and Planning | Supreme Court of India"
5,17-07-2018,TEHSEEN S. POONAWALLA vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 754/2016,Plea against lynching and mob violence by vigilante groups and the Supreme Court's guidelines to curb such unlawful activities.,"TEHSEEN S. POONAWALLA V. UNION OF INDIA2018 INSC 617 (17 July 2018)Justices:  Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Ajay M. Khanwilkar, Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. ChandrachudQuestion(s):  (i) Whether acts of lynching, where private individuals take the law into their own hands, is legal within India’s justice administration system. (ii) If not, what steps need to be taken to curtail such activities?Factual Background:  The Petitioner is a social activist who filed writ petitions in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking direction against violence by cow vigilantes and the removal of violent content from social media uploaded by such groups. Further, the Petition challenged Section 12 of the Gujarat Animal Prevention Act, 1954, Section 13 of the Maharashtra Animal Prevention Act, 1976, and Section 15 of the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964 as unconstitutional. These sections provide that no legal proceeding will be instituted against any person for anything which is in good faith under the Act. The Petitioners contended that these provisions were being misused to protect cow vigilantes from prosecution, even when they committed violent acts under the pretext of protecting cattle.Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously held that the act of lynching is unlawful. No individual has the authority to enforce the law and punish fellow citizens by their own hands. The Court held that it is the task of the law to provide a procedure for arrest, investigation, and trial. The State is obligated to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and liberties of every individual, regardless of their race, caste, class, or religion. The State is also responsible for promoting a secular, inclusive, and diverse societal framework. Further, the Court issued guidelines to curb the menace of vigilantism. However, the Court did not address the constitutional validity of the immunity provisions in the statutes challenged. The judgment was authored by Chief Justice Misra. Reasons for the Decision:  Duty of the State to eradicate vigilantismThe Supreme Court agreed with the submission of the Petitioner that no vigilante group can engage in lynching. The Court held that every individual has the right to report violations of the law to the police. It is the duty of the State to prevent crime and maintain public order. No one has the authority to take law enforcement into their own hands (¶15). Simultaneously, accused persons are entitled to a fair and speedy trial under the constitutional and statutory provisions. The judiciary is tasked with adjudicating and determining the guilt or innocence of a person. The Court held that justice is administered within courtrooms, not on the streets (¶15).The Supreme Court referred to Mohd. Haroon v. Union of India (2014 INSC 210), where the Supreme Court had held that the responsibility to prevent the recurrence of communal violence lies on the shoulders of the state administration (¶16). Further, any officer tasked with the maintenance of law and order will face legal consequences if found negligent (¶16). The State should find the cause behind the communal violence, strengthen police infrastructure, and initiate peace-building measures to curb communal violence (¶16).The Supreme Court held that the authorities are entrusted with upholding law and order and bear the primary duty to ensure that vigilantism, whether related to cow protection or any other cause, is prevented from occurring (¶17). Vigilantism undermines the legal and formal institutions of the State (¶18). The Court agreed with the submission of the Petitioner that if a law prescribes punishment, it provides mechanisms as well. It also found that allegations of cattle smuggling or cruel treatment of animals will be prevented and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies (¶¶17, 18).The Supreme Court held that vigilantism by mobs has to be prevented by the government and by society. Intolerance and polarisation, which is expressed through mobs, cannot be normalized (¶¶19-20). The freedom of speech and expression guarantees plurality of voices which is one of the essential foundations of liberal democracy (¶21). The State has an obligation to safeguard its citizens from vigilantism and lynching. (¶¶19-21).GuidelinesLastly, the Supreme Court recommended that the Parliament should create a separate offence of lynching which should be adequately punished (¶43), and the Court issued the following guidelines aimed at preventing and punishing all incidents of lynching and mob violence:Preventive Measures- Designation of senior police officers as Nodal Officers in each district to prevent incidents of mob violence and lynching; identification of areas with a history of lynching and mob violence; regular meetings with local intelligence units to identify vigilantism tendencies and prohibit dissemination of offensive material; police patrolling in sensitive areas to discourage anti-social elements; broadcasting on various media platforms that lynching and mob violence will have serious legal consequences; steps to curb dissemination of irresponsible messages on social media platforms; registration of FIRs under Section 153A of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (promoting enmity between different groups) against individuals who post inciting content which is likely to incite mob violence and lynching (¶40).Remedial Measures- Immediate lodging of FIRs by the jurisdictional police station in case of lynching or mob violence; personal monitoring of investigations by Nodal Officers to ensure effective handling and timely charge-sheet filing; preparation of Victim Compensation Scheme under section 357A of Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, considering bodily and psychological injuries, loss of earnings, and legal and medical expenses; fast-track trials in designated courts with daily hearings and conclusion within six months; maximum sentencing upon conviction to set a stern example; protection of witnesses and timely notice to victims or their next of kin about court proceedings (¶40).Punitive Measures- Disciplinary action against police or district officials for negligence or misconduct in preventing, investigating, or facilitating the trial of mob violence and lynching cases; direction to take disciplinary action against officials who fail to prevent incidents despite prior knowledge or delay in apprehending culprits (¶40).Prepared by Sakshi Komal Dubey (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

No. 7875-7879/2015,"The Supreme Court clarified the scope of legal practice under the Advocates Act, 1961, addressing the roles of foreign lawyers and firms in India, including their ability to provide legal services, ad","BAR COUNCIL OF INDIA V. A.K. BALAJI .2018 INSC 235 (13 March 2018)Justices:   Justice Adarsh K. Goel and Justice Uday U. LalitQuestion(s):   (i) Does the phrase “practise the profession of law” in Section 29 of Advocates Act, 1961 (“Advocates Act”) include only lawyers practising before courts or also include lawyers offering other types of legal services (e.g., in law firms)? (ii) Whether foreign lawyers, foreign law firms, or Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”) companies providing legal services in India, can do so without adhering to the Advocates Act and the Bar Council of India Rules, 1975 (“BCI Rules”). If not, can said foreign lawyers/law firms provide legal advice in India by visiting on a “fly-in-fly-out” basis? (iii) Are foreign lawyers/foreign law firms permitted to conduct international commercial arbitration proceedings in India?Factual Background:   When the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) authorised foreign law firms to open representative (liaison) offices in India, cases were filed before the Bombay and Madras High Courts challenging the RBI’s decision. The Madras High Court prohibited foreign lawyers or foreign law firms from practising law without complying with the Advocates Act and the BCI Rules. However, the High Court allowed them to visit India for short durations to give legal advice and conduct international arbitration proceedings.The Bombay HC, although agreeing with the prohibition on practising law, took a different stand, stating that these foreign entities cannot even provide legal advice on short visits to India. Further, they cannot perform arbitration unconditionally without being regulated by Indian laws. The Global Indian Lawyers Collective and the Bar Council of India (“BCI”) appealed to the Supreme Court of India due to the conflicting decisions by the two High Courts.Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Division Bench of the Supreme Court (two judges) concluded that the practice of law not only includes court appearances (litigation) but also giving opinions and drafting documents (non-litigation) as well. Further, the Court observed that only lawyers enrolled with the BCI can appear before courts; others can only do so with the relevant court’s permission. Moreover, even for non-litigious work, all foreign lawyers, foreign law firms, and BPO companies are subject to the Advocates Act and the BCI Rules. The judgement was authored by Justice Goel. The Supreme Court also held that legal advice by a foreign lawyer is valid when given on a “fly-in-fly-out” (temporary) basis if it is done regularly and not casually. Lastly, there exists no “absolute right” to conduct international commercial arbitration in India by foreign lawyers. However, if the Rules of Institutional Arbitration are applicable or if the matter falls under the provisions of the Arbitration Act, foreign lawyers may not be prohibited from participating in these proceedings. Nonetheless, they must adhere to the code of conduct governing the legal profession in India.  Reasons for the Decision:   The broad scope of legal practiceThe Supreme Court characterised the right to practise law as a broad right, and within this right existed two smaller, specific rights: firstly, the right to appear before a court (¶38), and secondly, the right to draft legal documents, provide consultancy services, and participate in legal conferences (¶38).Adherence of foreign lawyers/foreign law firms/BPO companies to the Advocates ActThe Supreme Court upheld the Bombay High Court’s view that the reason for enacting the Advocates Act was to regulate both persons practising before courts but also those practising in non-litigious matters outside courts (¶39). Further, Section 29 of the Advocates Act allows only advocates enrolled with the BCI to practise the profession of law whether before any Court/ authority or outside the Court. (¶16). The Supreme Court observed that this restriction is meant for both Indian citizens and foreigners alike (¶40). All foreign lawyers, foreign law firms, and BPO companies providing legal services (which directly or indirectly amount to the practice of law) have to comply with the Advocates Act and BCI Rules (¶¶40, 43).Nature of “fly-in-fly-out” visitsThe Supreme Court also reasoned that short-term/temporary i.e. “fly-in-fly-out” visits by foreign lawyers to provide legal guidance must be regular or frequent to constitute the practice of law; for instance, one or two casual visits per year are not regular (¶41). However, the meaning of the term “regular” is not fixed and will change based on the facts of each case and the decision of the individual court (¶41). Moreover, the Advocates Act and the BCI Rules will apply regardless of whether the guidance given pertains to foreign or domestic (Indian) law (¶41).Carrying-out of Arbitrations in India by foreign lawyers/foreign law firmsThe Supreme Court here noted that while a plain reading of Sections 32 or 33 of the Advocates Act does not lead to the imposition of an “inherent bar” on the conduction of international commercial arbitration by foreign entities, however, such proceedings must abide by the code of conduct applicable to the legal profession in India (¶42). Additionally, the court opined that the Central Government or the BCI have the power to create specific regulations regarding the arbitration proceedings (¶42).Prepared by Virendra Pratap Singh Rathod (Intern) Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,10-12-2019,RAJENDRA DIWAN vs PRADEEP KUMAR RANIBALA C.A. No. 3613/2016,Constitutional challenge to the power of a state legislature to create a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court.,"RAJENDRA DIWAN V. PRADEEP KUMAR RANIBALA 2019 INSC 1353 (10 December 2019)Justices:  Justice Arun Mishra, Justice Indira Banerjee, Justice Vineet Saran, Justice Mukeshkumar R. Shah, Justice Shripathi R. Bhatt Question(s):  Whether a State Legislature is competent to enact a law creating a direct statutory appeal from a Tribunal to the Supreme Court.Factual Background:  An appeal to the Supreme Court was filed under Section 13(2) of the Chhattisgarh Rent Control Act, 2011 (“Rent Control Act”) against an order of the Rent Control Tribunal. Section 13(2) of the Rent Control Act states that an appeal against an order of the Rent Control Tribunal can be made directly to the Supreme Court.The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court expressed concerns about the maintainability of the appeal, observing that it was unclear whether the Constitution empowered the State Legislatures to enact a law providing for an appeal directly to the Supreme Court. To resolve this constitutional question, the case was referred to a Constitution Bench (five judges).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench held that Section 13(2) of the Rent Control Act was unconstitutional as the State Legislature of Chhattisgarh lacked the legislative competence to create an appeal directly to the Supreme Court from the order of the Rent Control Tribunal. The Court held that a State Legislature could not enact any law affecting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, only the Parliament could exercise such power. Further, it was held that Presidential assent cannot validate a law that the state legislature never had the power to make. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Banerjee. Reasons for the Decision:  State Legislature cannot provide for extra-territorial operation of state lawsThe Supreme Court held that both Parliament and the State Legislatures derive their power to legislate from Article 245. It is understood that the legislature of a State will make laws for the whole or any part of the State, while Parliament will make laws for the whole or any part of the country. There is no provision in the Constitution which permits a State Legislature to legislate on matters beyond its territory (¶51).The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution divides powers between the Union and State legislatures through three lists: List I- the Union List (subjects only the Union can legislate on), the List II- State List (subjects only the States can legislate on), and the List III- Concurrent List (subjects both can legislate on, with Union law prevailing in case of conflict). The Supreme Court held that Entry 18 of List II only enables the State Legislature to legislate on landlord-tenant relationships, collection of rents, etc., and does not enable it to modify the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. While State Legislatures are empowered to enact laws on the jurisdiction and power of courts under Entry 64 of List II and Entry 46 of the Concurrent List this power specifically excludes the Supreme Court (¶52). Further, if a State Legislature were allowed to pass laws expanding the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction, it would render Entry 77 of List I, which gives Parliament the sole power to make laws regarding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, pointless (¶¶52, 53).Scope and Ambit of Article 323B The Rent Control Tribunal is established under Article 323B of the Constitution. Article 323B(3)(d) of the Constitution of India provides that laws made under this article may exclude the jurisdiction of all courts, except the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, concerning any matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunals. However, the Supreme Court held that these provisions do not permit expanding the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by enacting a provision allowing for a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court (¶55).Article 136 providing for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is not akin to statutory appealThe Supreme Court dismissed the Appellant’s argument that Section 13(2) of the Rent Control Act merely extends the Supreme Court’s existing jurisdiction under Article 136, which grants the Supreme Court discretionary power to allow special leave to appeal from any judgment or order passed by any court or tribunal in India. The Court clarified that Article 136 grants discretionary power to the Supreme Court to interfere in appropriate cases and is distinct from regular statutory appeals. The Court emphasized that under Article 136, the Supreme Court focuses on questions of law of public importance, not factual determinations made by lower courts as is in the case of statutory appeals (¶60). Conversely, Section 13(2) of the Rent Control Act attempts to grant a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court on issues that may not involve serious questions of law. An appeal is a continuation of original proceedings and mandates a reevaluation of facts and evidence (¶57-62).Effect of Presidential assentThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that when a State law gets the assent of the President of India, that law prevails in the States, notwithstanding a conflict with an earlier Union law. The Court held that Presidential assent does not validate a legislation that the state legislature never had the power to enact; nor does it validate a statutory provision that can render a provision of the Constitution ineffective (¶76).Prepared by Sakshi Komal Dubey (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

No. 8588/2019,"Constitutional challenge to the Finance Act, 2017 impacting the operation of various statutory tribunals.","ROJER MATHEW V. SOUTH INDIAN BANK LTD AND ORS CHIEF MANAGER2019 INSC 1236 (13 November 2019)Justices:  Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Deepak Gupta, Justice Nuthalapati V. Ramana, Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjiv KhannaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether a court can review the decision of the Speaker of Lok Sabha certifying a bill as a money bill. (ii) Whether the Finance Act, 2017 (“Finance Act”) is a money bill under Article 110 of the Constitution, given that it results in the alteration of the qualifications and conditions of service of the members of the various tribunals. (iii) If yes, whether Section 184 of the Finance Act is unconstitutional because it excessively delegates the power to make rules concerning the qualifications, and service conditions of tribunal members to the Union Government. (iv) Whether the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2017 (“Tribunal Rules”) are in compliance with the Finance Act they are framed under, and earlier decisions of the Supreme Court on the independence of tribunals.Factual Background:  Tribunals are bodies created by statutes to deal with specialised cases (e.g., electricity or labour disputes). On 22 March 2017, the Lok Sabha adopted the Finance Bill, 2017. It contained provisions to implement the Union Government’s fiscal policy and also included some non fiscal matters relating to tribunals. Part XIV of this Finance Bill merged various tribunals and Section 184 empowered the Union Government to frame rules regarding the eligibility, selection, and other conditions of service of the tribunal members.The Finance Bill received certification from the Speaker as a money bill and was passed on 30 March 2017 rejecting the recommendations of Rajya Sabha. When a bill is classified as a money bill under Article 110, the Lok Sabha can enact a money bill without the bill passing in the Rajya Sabha. Article 110 provides a list of fiscal subjects that a money bill can pertain to, and states that a bill is a money bill if it contains “only provisions dealing with” these identified subjects.In pursuance of Section 184, the Union Government notified the Tribunal Rules, laying out the criteria for selection, qualification, appointment, and other service conditions for tribunal members. A batch of petitions were filed before the Supreme Court questioning the constitutional validity of Part XIV of the Finance Act, and the Tribunal Rules.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court referred the question of whether the Finance Act, 2017 qualifies as a money bill to a larger bench of seven judges. The Court struck down the Tribunal Rules framed by the Union Government as unconstitutional because the Rules interfered with the independence of the tribunal members. Chief Justice Gogoi authored the majority opinion on behalf of himself, Justice Ramana and Justice Khanna. Justice Chandrachud and Justice Gupta wrote separate, partly dissenting, partly concurring opinions.The Supreme Court also recommended the Union Government frame new rules ensuring uniform and non discriminatory conditions of service for tribunal members. The majority held that Section 184 of the Finance Act has adequate guiding principles to inform the creation of new rules and thus did not constitute excessive delegation of legislative powers to the Union Government.In their separate dissenting opinions, both Justice Chandrachud and Justice Gupta held that defining the qualifications and terms of service of the members of a tribunal is at the heart of a tribunal’s functioning. They held that these conditions must be laid down by Parliament and cannot be delegated to the Union Government who is often one of the parties before the tribunal.Justice Chandrachud also directed the government to establish a National Tribunal Commission and establish an All India Tribunal Service for the selection of non adjudicatory personnel in tribunals.Reasons for the Decision:  Certification given by the Speaker is final but courts can review itThe Supreme Court rejected the argument that the Speaker's certification of the Finance Act as a money bill and its subsequent passage without the assent of Rajya Sabha is a question of legislative procedure and cannot be examined by courts (¶102 J. Gogoi). The Court observed that gross violations of the constitutional scheme are subject to judicial review on the ground of substantive illegality and unconstitutionality (¶¶102, 104 J. Gogoi; ¶40 J. Chandrachud). The majority observed that Article 110 does not contain an express bar on judicial review, unlike other provisions of the Constitution which explicitly state that courts should not look into certain matters (¶102 J. Gogoi).Justice Chandrachud in his separate opinion pointed that the finality of the decision of a Speaker operates only within the House of Parliament (¶¶32-35 J. Chandrachud). Thus, the certificate issued by the Speaker under Article 110(3) that a particular bill is a money bill cannot prevent judicial scrutiny (¶55 J. Chandrachud).The question of money bill to be referred to a larger benchThe majority referred to Justice Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2018 INSC 880) (“Aadhaar Judgment”) to determine what could be considered within the scope of a money bill. The majority observed that the Aadhaar Judgment classified the Aadhaar Act as a money bill without defining the scope of what constituted a money bill under Article 110 (¶122-123 J. Gogoi). Thus, no certainty about what constituted a money bill could be discerned from the Aadhaar Judgment.Justice Chandrachud’s separate opinion found that part XIV of the Finance Act cannot be classified as a money bill. He held that, to qualify as a money bill, the objectives stated in the bill should either directly relate to, or be incidental to the fiscal matters stated in Article 110 (¶30 J. Chandrachud). However, Justice Chandrachud agreed with the majority’s decision to refer the question to a larger bench (¶108 J. Chandrachud).Part XIV of the Finance Act does not suffer from excessive delegationThe majority held that the power to prescribe qualifications, selection procedures and service conditions of tribunal members need not rest solely with the legislature (¶148 J. Gogoi). Parliament should lay down policy guidelines in statutes that determine the nature of the rules to be framed by the Union Government (¶¶140, 141, 143 J. Gogoi). However, the mere possibility for abuse of rule-making powers, without any supporting evidence, is not a sufficient basis to strike down the provisions of the Finance Act (¶149 J. Gogoi).Justice Gupta in his dissent held that the Finance Act fails to include any guidelines regarding the terms and conditions of services for tribunal members (¶28 J. Gupta). This left the issue to be resolved entirely at the Government’s discretion. He observed that tribunal members play a crucial role in delivering justice to the public. Therefore, providing qualifications for them is a function that Parliament cannot delegate to the Union Government without proper guidelines (¶¶24, 27 J. Gupta). Justice Chandrachud concurred with this view, asserting that determining the qualifications of members to the tribunal is an essential legislative function that cannot be delegated (¶108 J. Chandrachud).The rules framed under Section 184 undermine the role and the independence of the judiciaryThe Supreme Court held that the search cum selection formed by the Tribunal Rules lacked the participation of the judiciary and was hence unconstitutional. This absence of a majority of judicial members in selecting tribunal appointees directly undermined the independence of the tribunals (¶¶153-154, 157 J. Gogoi; ¶¶90, 93 J. Chandrachud). The Court held that since the government is frequently a party before the tribunals, giving the government a dominant role in tribunal appointments creates a significant conflict of interest and threatens judicial independence (¶158 J. Gogoi; ¶93 J. Chandrachud).The majority held that the Tribunal Rules allowed for candidates without any adjudicatory experience to preside over the tribunals. This would dilute the standards of the tribunals and is against the prior rulings of the Supreme Court (¶¶159-162 J. Gogoi). Moreover, the Court emphasised that tribunal appointees should possess similar qualifications to that of a traditional judge (¶163 J. Gogoi).Prepared by Benila B MCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

3,02-08-2019,RITESH SINHA vs STATE OF UTTAR PRADESHCrl.A. No. 2003/2012,Constitutionality of requiring an accused person to provide a voice sample.,"RITESH SINHA V. STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH2019 INSC 855 (2 August 2019)Justices:  Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Deepak Gupta, Justice Sanjiv KhannaQuestion(s):  (i) Does Article 20(3) of the Indian Constitution, which protects an accused person from being compelled to be a witness against himself, also protect them from being compelled to provide a voice sample during an investigation? (ii) If Article 20(3) of the Indian Constitution is not violated, can a Magistrate authorise the recording of a voice sample from the accused person in the absence of specific provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”)?Factual Background:  The allegations against the accused Appellant Ritesh Sinha and co-accused Dhoom Singh pertained to orchestrating a job scam by promising positions in the police force for money. Pursuant to registration of the FIR, Dhoom Singh was arrested, and his mobile phone was seized to recover potential evidence.To authenticate a recorded conversation found on Singh’s phone, allegedly involving him and Sinha, the investigating authority sought Sinha’s voice sample. Subsequently, an application was submitted to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who ordered Sinha to provide his voice sample to the investigating officers. Challenging this order, Sinha approached the Allahabad High Court, where his petition was dismissed. Sinha then appealed to the Supreme Court.The appeal was heard by a Division Bench (two-judges) of the Supreme Court, resulting in a split verdict. Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai held that the voice sample will come within the purview of the Explanation (a) to Section 53 of CrPC which includes the phrase “such other tests.” Section 53 of the CrPC pertains to examination of the accused by a medical practitioner at the request of a police officer. Explanation (a) to Section 53 states that the examination shall include the examination of blood, blood stains, semen, swabs in case of sexual offences, sputum and sweat, hair samples and fingernail clippings by the use of modern and scientific techniques including DNA profiling and “such other tests” which the registered medical practitioner thinks necessary in a particular case. However, Justice Aftab Alam took the view that compelling an accused to give a voice sample can only be enabled under a new law and not through the process of judicial interpretation. This split decision resulted in the issue being placed before a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, relying on State of Bombay v. Kathi Kalu Oghad (1961 INSC 229) (“Kathi Kalu”), held that the prohibition against self-incrimination under Article 20(3) of the Constitution would not be violated if the accused is compelled to provide voice samples. Being compelled to produce purely forensic evidence such as thumb impressions, fingerprints or handwriting is not self-incriminatory, and thus does not violate Article 20(3). Only oral or written testimony based on personal knowledge of the accused is protected from compelled disclosure. The Supreme Court, relying on its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to do ‘complete justice’ (including filling in gaps in statutes) held that a judicial magistrate must be granted authority to order a person to give a voice sample. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice GogoiReasons for the Decision:  Compelling accused persons to give voice samples does not violate their right against self-incriminationThe Supreme Court reiterated the test laid down in the decision of Kathi Kalu and held that the testimony by an accused person will be self-incriminatory, only if it is of a character that if taken by itself, incriminates the accused. A specimen handwriting or signature or finger impressions by themselves are no testimony at all; they are only materials for comparison in order to lend assurance to the Court that its inference based on other pieces of evidence is reliable and, hence, they don’t come under the definition of “testimony” (¶9).The Supreme Court further held that by giving the evidence of specimen handwriting or the impressions of the accused person’s fingers, palm or foot it may be said that the accused person has been compelled to be a witness; it cannot however be said that he has been compelled to be a witness against himself (¶¶18-19).Judicial power can be exercised to fill the gaps in enactmentThe Supreme Court held that even though the compulsion to give voice samples is not explicitly mentioned in Section 53 or in Sections 53A and 311A of the CrPC, when there is a significant gap in law, judicial interpretation becomes necessary to ensure the effective functioning of the statute and to serve societal interests (¶20).The judicial role is not to create laws, but when it concerns the welfare of a large number of individuals who are not directly involved in the case before the Court, the Court must address the lacuna not only by applying the principle of ejusdem generis to the phrase “such other tests” appearing in the explanation (a) to section 53 of Cr PC, but also on the principle of imminent necessity (¶21).More here: The principle of ‘ejusdem generis’ means ‘of the same kind or nature’. It is used to interpret unclear or general terms in a list, suggesting that these terms should be understood in the context of the more specific items listed before them. The principle of imminent necessity allows courts to fill significant gaps in the law to ensure the statute functions effectively and serves societal interests, even if the specific action, like giving voice samples, is not explicitly mentioned.Prepared by Zuber Ali (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,02-03-2020,IN RE ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION vs W.P.(C) No. 1099/2019,Whether the constitutional challenge to the abrogration of Article 370 should be heard by a bench of five judges or by a bench of seven judges.,"IN RE ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION V. 2020 INSC 253 (2 March 2020)Justices:  Justice Nuthalapati V. Ramana, Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Ramayyagari S. Reddy, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, and Justice Surya KantQuestion(s):  Whether a larger bench (more than five judges) is required to hear the matter concerning the removal of Article 370 of the Constitution in view of the alleged conflict between the decisions in Prem Nath Kaul v. State of Jammu and Kashmir (“Prem Nath Kaul”) and Sampat Prakash v. State of Jammu and Kashmir (“Sampat Prakash”)Factual Background:  Following the execution of the ‘Instrument of Accession’ by the Maharaja of Kashmir with India in October 1947, Article 370 was added to the Indian Constitution and provided for special provisions concerning the State of Jammu and Kashmir (“J&K”). This article restricted the legislative authority of the Union Parliament over J&K. The entire Constitution of India was not applicable to the J&K, and J&K had its own Constitution. Further, according to Article 370(3), the special status of J&K could not be amended or repealed, unless theConstituent Assemblyof J&K recommended it.On 20 December 2018, President’s Rule (State emergency) was imposed in J&K. On 5 August 2019, two Constitution Orders (“C.O.s”) were issued by the President in exercise of his power under Article 370. C.O. 272 made all the provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to J&K, and rendered the Constitution of J&K obsolete. It also allowed for the removal of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution based on the recommendation of the State Legislature of J&K instead of the J&K Constituent Assembly. Given that J&K was under President’s rule, the powers of the J&K State Legislature were exercised by the Union Parliament, which recommended the repeal of Article 370. Subsequently, C.O. 273 was issued, which repealed Article 370 upon the recommendation of Parliament, thereby eliminating the special status of J&K.While the constitutional validity of C.O. 272 and C.O. 273 was under challenge before a Constitution Bench (five judges), a reference was sought to a larger bench in view of an apparent conflict between the two Constitution Bench (five judge) decisions of Prem Nath Kaul (1959 INSC 17) and Sampat Prakash (1968 INSC 265).The Petitioners argued that the Supreme Court in Prem Nath Kaul had held that the Indian Government’s Parliamentary and Presidential powers over J&K were subject to the final approval of the J&K Constituent Assembly. Therefore, in the Petitioners’ arguments, once the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, the Indian Government’s powers to pass C.O.s concerning J&K under Article 370 ceased to be exercisable because there was no Constituent Assembly to approve such C.O.s. Despite this, the subsequent decision in Sampat Prakash upheld the validity of a C.O. concerning J&K after the Constituent Assembly of J&K was dissolved. Therefore, it was contended that Prem Nath Kaul and Sampat Prakash were in conflict with each other as they took different views on whether the President’s powers to issue C.O.s concerning J&K continued to operate after the Constituent Assembly of J&K was dissolved. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court unanimously concluded that there is no conflict between the judgments in the Prem Nath Kaul and the Sampat Prakash. The Court therefore declined to refer the issue to a larger bench. The Court also held that the case of Sampat Prakash was not incorrect because it failed to consider the earlier decision in Prem Nath Kaul. This decision paved the way for the legality of abolition of Article 370 to be decided by a Constitution Bench (five judges) as opposed to a larger bench of seven judges. Reasons for the Decision:  No conflict between the judgmentsThe Supreme Court held that the judgments in Prem Nath Kaul and Sampat Kumar should be read in their respective contexts. The circumstances in which these cases were decided, and the issues involved in each case, were completely different.The Supreme Court observed that in Prem Nath Kaul, the issue before the Court was the legislative competence of the Yuvraj to pass ‘J&K Big Landed Estate (Abolition) Act, 1950’ (¶38). This law was passed before the adoption of the Constitution of J&K, but after coming into force of the Constitution of India. It was in this context that the Court in Prem Nath Kaul made certain observations regarding the importance given to the decision of the J&K Constituent Assembly. Article 370(2) was a temporary measure which required the interim State Government to place its decisions before the J&K Constituent Assembly for final ratification. This was because at the time, the Constitution of J&K was not finalised, so the Constituent Assembly was to finalise the decisions taken by the State Government. Thus, the Court held the requirement of placing the decisions taken by the State Government before the Constituent Assembly of J&K and the finality accorded to the Assembly’s decisions inPrem Nath Kaulwas limited to the decisions taken prior to the J&K Constituent Assembly being convened and dissolved. The decision in Prem Nath Kaul was not concerned with the operation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India after the J&K Constituent Assembly was dissolved. (¶¶42-44).InSampat Prakash, the issue pertained to the detention of a petitioner who had challenged the modification of C.O.s under Article 370 which had extended the validity of a preventive detention law.Thus, Sampat Prakashwas the first time that the Court directly dealt with the question of continuance of the President’s powers under Article 370 after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of J&K (¶40). Given these differing contexts, there was no conflict between Prem Nath Kaul and Sampat Prakash.Rule of per incuriamThe Supreme Court held that the rule of per incuriam has been developed as an exception to the doctrine of judicial precedent. It means a judgment passed in ignorance of a relevant statute or any other binding authority (¶28). Noting that Sampat Prakash did not make any observations contrary to those made in Prem Nath Kaul because they dealt with two factually and legally distinct periods in J&K, the Court held that the case of Sampat Prakash was not per incuriam (¶46).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,28-06-2021,THE STATE OF KERALA vs LEESAMMA JOSEPHC.A. No. 59/2021,Right of persons with disabilities to reservations in promotion.,"THE STATE OF KERALA V. LEESAMMA JOSEPH2021 INSC 309 (28 June 2021)Justices:  Justice Sanjay K. Kaul and Justice Ramayyagari S. ReddyQuestion(s):  Whether the Respondent can be promoted under a promotion quota for persons with disabilities (“PwDs”) despite the fact that she was not appointed under a PwD quota.Factual Background:  In 1995, Parliament enacted the the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act (“PwD Act 1995”) which was later replaced by the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (“RPwD Act 2016”).Leesamma Joseph the Respondent, was appointed as a Typist/Clerk in the Kerala Police Department in 1996 on compassionate grounds after her brother had passed away during service. The Respondent had Post Polio Residual Paralysis (L) and her permanent disability had been assessed at fifty-five percent. She cleared departmental tests for promotion and was promoted to Lower Division Clerk (“LDC”) in July 2001. She was later promoted to Senior Clerk in September 2004, and then to the post of Cashier in May 2015.The Respondent claimed that she was entitled to earlier promotion as a Senior Clerk with effect from July 2002, and as a Cashier with effect from May 2012, with all consequential benefits, and also promotion to Junior Superintendent. This claim was made on the basis of her entitlement to PwD reservation under the provisions of the PwD Act 1995.The Kerala Administrative Tribunal rejected her plea stating that the rule of recruitment in the State of Kerala, general rules, and other orders issued by the government under Section 32 of the PwD Act 1995 did not provide for any reservation in promotion but only on initial appointments.The Kerala High Court set aside the decision of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal, and ruled in favor of the Respondent, holding that PwDs are entitled to reservation in promotions. The State of Kerala appealed this decision in the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court held that the PwD Act 1995 mandates reservation in promotions for persons with disabilities, and the Respondent was entitled to the claimed promotions with retrospective effect. The Court directed the State of Kerala to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court in the cases of Rajeev Kumar Gupta v Union of India (2016 INSC 482) and Siddaraju v State of Karnataka (2020 INSC 36) within three months to provide for reservation in promotion in all identified posts. In these cases, the Supreme Court had ruled that three percent reservation must be provided to PwDs including in promotions.Reasons for the Decision:  Not a criterion for promotionThe Supreme Court referred to its previous decisions and stated that once a position was identified for a PwD quota, it had to be set aside for such persons regardless of how the State planned to fill that position (¶17). The Court noted that the mode of entry in service was not a relevant criterion for promotion for persons who were part of the disability quota (¶27). A person with a disability would be considered for promotion along with other persons working in the feeder cadre (¶20).The Supreme Court held that it would be discriminatory and violative of the mandate of the Constitution of India if the Respondent was not considered for promotion in the PwD quota on the pretext that the Respondent was not initially appointed in the quota for PwD in the feeder cadre (¶27). The Court stated that once the Respondent had been appointed, she had to be treated identically to others in PwDs (¶27).The Supreme Court also clarified that the 1995 Act did not make a distinction between a person who may have entered service on account of disability, and the person who may have acquired disability after having entered the service (¶27). The mode of entry in service was not a ground to deny promotion based on reservation provided to PwDs (¶27).Interpretation of the PwD Act 1995The Supreme Court stated that the mandate of Section 32 of the PwD Act 1995 required the government to identify the posts that can be filled up by PwDs in establishments that are either created by statute or owned or controlled by the government or local authority (¶20). Thus, this meant that even the posts in promotional cadres must be identified for persons with disability and such posts must be reserved for them (¶20). The identification of such posts in promotional cadres is necessary for reservations in promotion for persons with disability (¶20).The Supreme Court stated that once a post is identified, the logical conclusion would be that it would be reserved for persons with disabilities who have been promoted (¶20). The absence of rules to provide for reservation in promotion would not defeat the rights of persons with disability to a reservation in promotion since that right flows from the law (¶20).Interpretation of the RPwD Act 2016The Supreme Court referred to Vikash Kumar v Union Public Service Commission (2021 INSC 78) where it had held that the government must not discriminate and must provide reasonable accommodations and create an accessible work environment for employees with disabilities. The Court found that these principles mandate that an employee who acquires a disability during service should not be denied promotion solely based on that disability (¶23).Prepared by Kolipaka Prameela (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,15-12-2022,NEERAJ DUTTA vs STATE(GOVT.OF N.C.T.OF DELHI)Crl.A. No. 1669/2009,"Whether a public servant can be convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 without direct evidence.","NEERAJ DUTTA V. STATE(GOVT.OF N.C.T.OF DELHI)2022 INSC 1280 (15 December 2022)Justices:  Justice Syed A. Nazeer, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice V. Ramasubramanian and Justice B. V. NagarathnaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether, a public servant can be convicted under sections 7 and 13(1)(d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 without direct evidence of a demand for illegal gratification?; and (ii) Whether the Three-Judge Bench decisions of the Supreme Court in the case P. Satyanarayana Murthy v District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra Pradesh(“P. Satyanarayana Murthy”), B. Jayaraj v State of Andhra Pradesh(“B. Jayaraj”) and M. Narsinga Rao v State of Andhra Pradesh (“M. Narsinga Rao”) are in conflict with each other?Factual Background:  On 17 April 2000, the Petitioner, a Lower Divisional Clerk at Delhi Vidyut Board, allegedly demanded a Rs.10,000 bribe from Mr. Rajvit Sethi for installing an electricity meter. Mr. Sethi filed an FIR, leading to a sting operation that captured the Petitioner accepting the bribe. The Petitioner was subsequently charged under sections 7 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (“PCA”) for taking bribes or receiving ‘illegal gratification’, and for criminal misconduct.Before the evidence could be recorded of Mr. Rajvit, who was a primary witness in the case, passed away. Primary witnesses play a vital role in substantiating facts of the case by offering oral evidence, classified as direct evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (“Evidence Act”).The Trial Court, in the absence of direct evidence, relied on circumstantial evidence, including police statements, to convict the Petitioner. The Delhi High Court upheld the Trial Court’s decision on 2 April 2009, prompting the Petitioner to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Division Bench of the Supreme Court noted a conflict in previous three Three-Judge Bench decisions of the Supreme Court, regarding the proof required under the PCA when the primary witness is unavailable.In P. Satyanarayana, the Supreme Court had held that relying on circumstantial evidence was not permissible under the law. This judgment and the judgment in B. Jayaraj were potentially in conflict with the judgment in M. Narsinga Rao, where the Supreme Court upheld a conviction despite the absence of primary evidence. In light of these conflicting decisions, the current case was referred to a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that a person can be convicted under section 7 and section 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the PCA, for illegal gratification and its subsequent acceptance, either by direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. The Court clarified that the death of a complainant or primary witness, or the turning of a complainant hostile does not automatically result in the acquittal of the accused.The Supreme Court held that the three decisions of the Supreme Court are not in conflict with each other and the facts in each case were slightly different from each other which resulted in differing decisions. The Constitution Bench (five judges) judgment was authored by Justice B. V. Nagarathna. Reasons for the Decision:  Difference between ‘Acceptance’ and ‘Obtainment’ of BribeThe Supreme Court drew a distinction between section 7 (Accepting Gratification) and section 13 (Criminal Misconduct by Public Servant) of the PCA (¶68(d)). Section 7 concerns a bribe giver making an 'offer' to pay without any prior demand from the public servant (¶68(d)(i)). If the public servant merely accepts the offer, receiving illegal gratification, it is deemed as an 'acceptance' under section 7 (¶68(d)(i)). On the other hand, section 13 of the PCA concerns a public servant initiating a 'demand,' and the bribe giver subsequently agreeing to make the payment (¶68(d)(ii)). If, following the demand, the public servant receives the bribe, it constitutes an 'obtainment' and is punishable under section 13 of the PCA (¶68(d)(ii)).The mere acceptance or receipt of an illegal gratification without proving any offer by the bribe-giver or demand by the public servant would not constitute an offence under section 7 or section 13(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the PCA (¶68(d)(iii)).Circumstantial Evidence permissible to sustain convictionThe Supreme Court explained all evidence before a court is classified either as direct or circumstantial evidence (¶53). Direct evidence means when a fact is confirmed directly by witnesses, things or documents (¶53). Circumstantial evidence is indirect evidence, where a fact is proved based on the surrounding circumstances (which are themselves proved by direct evidence) (¶53). Courts must adopt a cautious approach while basing its conviction purely on circumstantial evidence (¶54).The issue in the present case was proving ‘demand’ under the PCA in the absence of direct evidence from a complainant who might not cooperate, turn hostile, or be unavailable due to reasons like death (¶2). The Supreme Court ruled that demand and/or acceptance could be established through circumstantial evidence, allowing the use of other witnesses or indirect evidence to prove guilt (¶68(c)).Presumption can be based on surrounding factsUnder Section 20 of PCA, it can be presumed that the accused public servant accepted gratification as a motive or reward for performing or refraining from any official act (¶48). The only condition is that, during the trial, there must be proof that the accused public servant accepted or agreed to accept the gratification (¶48). Section 20 does not require that the public servant’s acceptance or agreement must be established solely through direct evidence (¶48). The Supreme Court therefore held that courts have discretion to make this presumption by inferring conclusions from other established facts (¶68(e)).No conflict in the three Three-Judge Bench decisionsThe Supreme Court found that in B. Jayaraj, the complainant did not support the prosecution case and was declared hostile, and it was held that in the absence of proof of demand, the offence under section 7 could not be established (¶10(A)(i)). In P. Satyanarayana Murthy, the complainant had died prior to giving evidence in the case, and in absence of proof of demand of illegal gratification, the offence could not be established (¶10B(iii)). In M. Narasinga Rao, the prosecution witness turned hostile and denied that the official had demanded a bribe (¶10C(ii)). However, the Court in that case observed that the circumstances proved allowed the court to draw a factual presumption that the official willingly received the tainted currency notes, and consequently the legal presumption under section 20 of the PCA was applied (¶¶10C(iv), 10C(vi)). Based on the analysis of the cases it was held that there is no conflict in these decisions (¶69).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

2,05-12-2022,SUKHPAL SINGH KHAIRA vs THE STATE OF PUNJABCrl.A. No. 885/2019,Power of a court to summon a new accused after trial has ended.,"SUKHPAL SINGH KHAIRA V. THE STATE OF PUNJAB2022 INSC 1252 (5 December 2022)Justices:  Justice Syed A. Nazeer, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice V. Ramasubramanian and Justice B. V. NagarathnaQuestion(s):  (i) Can a trial court summon a new accused person under Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (“CrPC”) after the trial has ended? (ii) If in criminal proceedings against multiple accused, the trial has been separated between (1) physically present accused; and (2) absconding accused persons, can a new accused be summoned in the second set of proceedings after the first has concluded? (iii) What guidelines must courts follow while summoning a new accused under Section 319 of the Code?Factual Background:  A case was registered against eleven persons for offences committed under various laws, including the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. On 31 October 2017, the Sessions Court convicted nine of the accused and acquitted two. On the same day, after the conviction judgment was pronounced, the Sessions Court issued a Summoning Order against five additional persons under section 319 of the CrPC.Section 319 of the CrPC empowers the court to summon additional accused if the evidence produced in the case suggests their involvement in the alleged offence, provided the summons order is issued “in the course of” any inquiry or trial.The newly accused individuals (the Petitioners) challenged the Summoning Order at the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The High Court upheld the Summoning Order, leading the Petitioners to the Supreme Court.Before the Supreme Court, the Petitioners contended that the Summoning Order can only be issued “in the course” of an inquiry and trial and cannot be issued after the conclusion of the trial as it deprives the accused of the right to be informed of the accusations and defend themselves while evidence is being examined, which is only possible during the course of trial. The Respondents contended that summoning an accused after the conclusion of trial was a mere procedural irregularity that should be excused in light of the objective of Section 319 to do complete justice. The issue was referred to a Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court determined that a Summoning Order under Section 319 of the CrPC is made “in the course” of a trial if: (i) in the case of acquittal it is made before acquittal is pronounced; and (ii) in the case of conviction, it is made prior to the final sentencing order. If the summoning order and either the acquittal order or sentencing order (in case of conviction) are issued on the same day, then the facts and circumstances of each case must be examined to see if the summoning order precedes the conclusion of trial. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Bopanna.Where trial proceedings are bifurcated between physically present accused and absconding accused, the Supreme Court ruled that trial courts can summon additional accused individuals in the subsequent proceedings against absconding individuals if the evidence on which the Summoning Order is based on arises from the subsequent proceedings against absconding individuals. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the Summoning Order cannot be founded on evidence recorded in the main concluded trial (against physically present people) if the power under Section 319 had not been utilised in the main trial until its completion.The Supreme Court also established guidelines to be followed under Section 319 of the CrPC. Some of the key guidelines it laid down are: (i) If, during trial, evidence or an application implicates another person in the offence, the court must pause proceedings, and first assess the need to summon the additional accused, and issue summoning orders if deemed necessary; (ii) The decision on joint or separate trials for the summoned accused is then made, with a joint trial commencing only after securing the new accused’s presence; (iii) If the power is invoked after judgment is reserved, the court should set the case for rehearing, following the specified procedure; and (iv) In the event of a joint trial, it should be conducted afresh, and if a separate trial is decided, proceedings against the summoned accused can proceed after pronouncing judgment in the main case.Reasons for the Decision:  Object of Section 319The Supreme Court found that Section 319 of the Code was introduced to ensure that an accused, not initially charge-sheeted but found to be involved in the crime during the trial, does not escape legal consequences (¶19). This section empowers the court to summon and try such an accused alongside others before the conclusion of the trial (¶19).When does trial end?As a Summoning Order can only be issued “in the course” of trial, a key question was when trial is deemed to end (¶21). The Supreme Court observed that a trial ends at different points depending on whether the trial ends in acquittal or conviction (¶¶22-23). In cases of acquittal, the court will record an acquittal order under Sections 232 or 235 of the CrPC and the trial is concluded (¶22). However, in the case of conviction after the judgment ordering conviction, there is also a subsequent sentencing decision (¶¶21, 23). Thus, for cases that end in conviction, the trial is not complete upon a finding of guilt, it continues until the judge determines the appropriate sentence and pronounces the sentence (¶23).Additional accused can be summoned in separate trial, provided evidence produced in that specific trial indicates accused’s involvementThe Supreme Court clarified that the mere bifurcation of a trial against an absconding accused does not automatically validate an order under Section 319 summoning an additional accused in the earlier concluded main trial against physically present individuals (¶30). The exercise of such power depends on evidence recorded in a specific case indicating the involvement of the accused to be summoned (¶30). If, in a split case against the absconding accused, evidence against absconding accused points to the involvement of another person, Section 319 can be invoked in that split case before its conclusion, but not based on evidence produced in the earlier concluded main trial (¶30).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

3,07-11-2022,JANHIT ABHIYAN vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 55/2019,Constitutional challenge to the 103rd Constitutional Amendment granting reservations to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of society.,"JANHIT ABHIYAN V. UNION OF INDIA2022 INSC 1175 (7 November 2022)Justices:  Chief Justice Uday U. Lalit, Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, Justice Ravindra Bhat, Justice Bela M. Trivedi, Justice Jamshed B. PardiwalaQuestion(s):  (i) Does the 103rd Constitution Amendment, providing reservation to economically weaker sections (“EWS”) violate the basic structure of the Constitution of India? (ii) Does the exclusion of SEBCs/OBCs/SCs/STs from EWS reservation violate the right to equality? (iii) Whether EWS reservations of up to 10% in addition to the existing reservations violate the 50% limit on reservations set by earlier decisions of the Supreme Court?Factual Background:  On 9 January 2019, Parliament enacted the 103rd Constitution Amendment Act. This amendment inserted Articles 15(6) and 16(6) into the Constitution of India, andintroduced a maximum of 10% reservation forEWS in admissions to educational institutions (except for minority educational institutions) and in public employment.The 10% EWS reservation was in addition to existing reservations granted to Scheduled Castes (15%), Scheduled Tribes (7.5%), and the non-creamy layer of Other Backward Classes (27%). This brought the total reservation to 59.50%. However, beneficiaries of existing reservations, i.e, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and the non-creamy layer of Other Backward Classes were excluded from EWS reservations.A batch of petitions were filed before the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the 103rd Constitution Amendment. The arguments made by the Petitioners were: (i) basing reservations solely on economic criteria is impermissible; (ii) excluding SEBCs/OBCs/SCs/STs from the benefit of EWS is discriminatory; (iii) providing for 10% additional reservation directly breaches the 50% ceiling limit on reservations set by the decisions of the Supreme Court; and (iv) imposing reservations on educational institutions that donotreceive State aidviolates the fundamental right to equality. The Union of India contended that economic criteria is a relevant consideration for affirmative action and Articles 15(6) and 16(6) of the Constitution are in conformity with the equality doctrine.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) upheld the 103rd Constitution Amendment by 3:2 majority. Justices Maheshwari, Trivedi and Pardiwala wrote separate opinions upholding the validity of the Amendment. Justice Bhat wrote a dissenting opinion for himself and Chief Justice Lalit, which found the 103rd Constitution Amendment to be unconstitutional.All five Judges agreed that reservations can be provided based on economic criteria. It was held that affirmative action can be provided in favour of the disadvantaged groups who have been unable to progress due to poverty. The Court by majority of 3:2 held that SCs, STs and OBCs can be excluded from the scope of EWS reservations by treating EWS as a separate class, different from those who are already benefiting from reservations.The majority further found that 10% EWS reservation in excess of the existing 50% limit on reservations set out inIndra Sawhney v. Union of India ((1992) Supp. 2 SCR 454)(“Indra Sawhney”) was constitutional. It was held that the 50% limit is flexible and it may be breached in extraordinary situations.Justice Bhat writing for himself, and Chief Justice Lalit held that the exclusion of SEBCs, SCs, STs and OBCs from EWS reservations results in discrimination against the poorest sections of the society who are socially and educationally backward and have been subjected to caste discrimination. Their exclusion violates the principle of equality. He therefore held that the 103rd Constitution Amendment was unconstitutional because it violated the basic structure of the Constitution by discriminating against SEBCs, SCs, STs and OBCs (non-creamy layer).Reasons for the Decision:  Reservations can be based solely on economic criterionThe Supreme Court unanimously held that reservation based exclusively on economic criteria is permissible and helps in uplifting the poorest segments of society. It helps in achieving economic justice which the Preamble as well as Articles 38 and 46 of the Constitution recognise (¶124 J. Bhat, ¶¶68, 70 J. Pardiwala, ¶¶72-75 J. Maheshwari, ¶16 J. Trivedi). It was held that economic backwardness is not confined only to those who are covered by existing reservations such as SCs, STs, and OBCs (¶¶74.1.1, 74.2.3 J. Maheshwari ¶57 J. Pardiwala, ¶166 J. Bhat).Justice Bhat’s dissenting opinion held that reservation based on economic criteria for ensuring ‘access’ to public goods is permissible, however, the same is not true for reservation in public employment. This is because the aim of reservation in public employment is empowerment through ‘representation’ of a community (¶¶97, 102 ,193 J. Bhat). Justice Bhat held that individuals benefiting from EWS reservations likely belong to socially “forward” classes or castes which are already adequately represented in public service (¶131 J. Bhat). Thus, additional reservation for a class that is already well-represented violates the principle of equality of opportunity (¶ 131 J. Bhat).Exclusion of SEBCs/OBCs/SCs/STs from the benefit of EWS reservation is permissibleThe Supreme Court held that the 103rd Constitution Amendment makes a reasonable classification between “economically weaker sections” and other disadvantaged sections already benefiting from reservations under Articles 15(4), 15(5) and 16(4) of the Constitution (¶79 J. Maheshwari, ¶20 J. Trivedi, ¶168 J. Pardiwala). Since SEBCs, STs, SCs, and OBCs already benefit from reservations, providing them an additional benefit which is meant specifically for economically weaker sections was deemed unnecessary. It was held that just as equals cannot be treated unequally, unequals also cannot be treated equally (¶¶78-79 J. Maheshwari, ¶20 J. Trivedi, ¶174 J. Pardiwala).Moreover, the Supreme Court emphasised that exclusion is a crucial aspect for all reservations to ensure the intended group receives full benefits (¶79 J. Maheshwari). It was held that the argument by the Petitioners that excluding these groups is discriminatory overlooks the fact that, by excluding the creamy layer, the economically lower strata of SCs, STs and OBCs are already represented in the categories covered by Articles 15(4), 15(5), and 16(4) (¶¶82.1-83.1 J. Maheshwari, ¶ 172 J. Pardiwala).Justice Bhat and Chief Justice Lalit in their dissenting opinion held that exclusion of SCs, STs, OBCs from reservation based on economic criteria violates their right to equality (¶190 J. Bhat). He held that EWS reservation aims to help the poorest members of society and poverty affects everyone, regardless of social or educational backwardness. For communities facing social and educational discrimination, poverty has a more severe impact. (¶¶93,99 J. Bhat). Justice Bhat pointed out that it is unclear how excluding those who comprise 82% of the country’s population (SC, ST and OBC together) who would otherwise qualify for EWS reservation, would contribute to the upliftment of economically weaker sections of society (¶91 J. Bhat). He held that the exclusion of SEBCs/SCs/STs/OBCs from a benefit they would otherwise be eligible for, because of their social and educational backwardness, effectively discriminated against them (¶93 J. Bhat).50% ceiling limit on reservations is not inflexibleJustice Maheshwari held that the 50% ceiling limit on reservations as provided in the case of Indra Sawhney is flexible. The rule of 50% may be relaxed for compelling reasons and in extraordinary situations. He clarified that no decision of the Court could be read to mean that Parliament cannot enact additional reservations if it deemed it necessary (¶¶91-94 J. Maheshwari).However, Justice Bhat cautioned against permitting a breach of the 50% rule. He observed that this could potentially diminish the right to equality to a mere right to reservation (¶178 J. Bhat).EWS reservation in private educational institutions not funded by government is validRelying on the decision in Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (Registered) v. Union of India, the Supreme Court affirmed that providing EWS reservations in private educational institutions under Article 15(6) does not violate the right to equality (¶103 J. Maheshwari, ¶¶52-53 J. Pardiwala).Justice Bhat held that even though reservations in private educational institutions are permissible, this issue is rendered irrelevant since he had concluded the 103rd Constitution Amendment was unconstitutional. He observed that private educational institutions, despite not being State entities, contribute significantly to national goals by improving educational standards, and were not merely entities serving the private objectives of their founders (¶¶136, 138 J. Bhat).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaDay 8 of Arguments: 27 September 2022 (Video Recording)Case Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

No. 8486/2011,Whether the number of judges in the majority or the size of the bench determines the precedential value of a judgment.,"M/S TRIMURTHI FRAGRANCES (P) LTD. THROUGH ITS DIRECTOR SHRI PRADEEP KUMAR AGRAWAL V. GOVT.OF N.C.T OF DELHI THROUGH ITS PRINCIPAL SECRETARY (FINANCE)2022 INSC 975 (19 September 2022)Justices:  Justice Indira Banerjee, Justice Hemant Gupta, Justice Surya Kant, Justice M.M. Sundresh, and Justice Sudhanshu DhuliaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the decision in Kothari Products Ltd. v. State of A.P. or the decision in Central Sales Tax v. Agra Belting Work is correct on whether a State can tax ‘Pan Masala’ and ‘Gutka’? (ii) Whether a unanimous (3:0) decision of a Three Judge Bench has more precedential value than a 2:1 majority decision of a Three Judge Bench?Factual Background:  This case concerned the taxability of ‘Pan Masala’ or ‘Gutka’ under State Sales Tax Acts, given that ‘tobacco’ was already taxed by the Union Government under the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act 1957 (“ADE Act”).The ADE Act levies a tax on ‘tobacco’. The law is settled that once goods are taxed under the ADE Act, the State cannot impose sales tax on them under a State law. On 31 March, 2000, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi issued a notification to include ‘Pan Masala and Gutka’ in the First Schedule, making it taxable under the State Act.In 2004, Shanti Fragrances challenged the Lieutenant Governor’s notification in the Delhi High Court, arguing that ‘Pan Masala and Gutka’ were already covered under the general ‘Tobacco’ entry in the ADE Act and were thus exempt from State taxation. Shanti Fragrances relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in Kothari Products Ltd. v Govt. of Andhra Pradesh (“Kothari Products”). In response, the Revenue Department relied upon the Supreme Court’s decision inCommissioner, Sales Tax, Uttar Pradesh v. Agra Belting Works(“Agra Belting Works”) to argue that Pan Masala and Gutka should be taxable under state law.On 5 November 2004, the High Court of Delhi dismissed the writ petition by relying on Agra Belting Works. The judgment of the Delhi High Court was challenged before the Supreme Court. The Allahabad and Madras High Courts also delivered similar judgements. These High Courts further held that State Legislatures were competent to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of items taxed under the ADE Act.During the course of hearing, a two judge bench of the Supreme Court noted a conflict between Kothari Products and Agra Belting Works, both Three Judge Bench decisions of the Supreme Court. Kothari Products was unanimous (3:0), while Agra Belting Works had a 2:1 majority. To resolve the conflict concerning the State taxes on Pan Masala and Gutka, and to determine the precedential value of a judgment (whether a unanimous decision by a three judge bench holds greater precedential value than a decision delivered by a 2:1 majority), the bench referred the case to a Constitution Bench.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) unanimously held that there was no conflict between the judgments rendered in Kothari ProductsandAgra Belting Works.On the question of precedential value, the Court held that this issue had been addressed by a previous Constitution bench in Dr. Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil v. The Chief Minister. In that case, the Court had ruled that a decision delivered by a Bench of larger strength is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength, regardless of the specific number of judges in the majority. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Banerjee on behalf of herself and Justices Kant, Sundresh, and Dhulia. Justice Gupta wrote a separate concurring opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  There is no conflict between the Kothari Products line of cases and the Agra Belting line of casesThe Supreme Court concluded that there is no direct conflict between the Kothari Products line of cases and the Agra Belting Works line of cases (¶17). In theKothari Productsline of cases, the question of whether ‘gutka’ being ‘tobacco’ specified in the First Schedule to the ADE Act could be taxed under state statutes. It was held that State laws could not tax ‘gutka’ because it was already taxed under the ADE Act (¶8). On the other hand, theAgra Belting Worksline of cases concerned the interplay between a general exemption of specified goods from sales tax and the subsequent specification of rates of sales tax for such exempted goods. The Court in Agra Belting Works pointed out that if a notification grants exemption from tax, and later, a subsequent notification (under another provision) prescribes the rate of tax, the intention is to withdraw the exemption and impose the tax at the rate prescribed in the later notification (¶12).Bench strength is determinative of the binding nature of the JudgmentThe Supreme Court held that the second issue concerning the precedential value of a judgement was already answered by the previous Constitution Bench judgment in Dr. Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil v. The Chief Minister (¶18). In that case it was held that a unanimous decision of a five judge bench (5:0) would not be a reason to doubt the correctness of a later seven judge bench even though the seven judge decision was made by a smaller majority (e.g., 4:3). The decision of the seven judge bench would be the correct and binding decision. Justice Banerjee held that in view of Article 145(5) of the Constitution of India, a concurrence of a majority of the judges at the hearing will be considered as a judgment of the Court (¶19). The Court affirmed the settled principle that the majority decision of a bench of larger strength would prevail over the decision of a bench of lesser strength, irrespective of the number of Judges constituting the majority in the smaller bench (¶19).In his separate and concurring opinion, Justice Gupta also concluded that the strength of the bench, rather than the number of judges who have taken a certain position, is the relevant consideration. He further held that a smaller bench cannot disagree with or dissent from the view of law taken by a larger bench (¶G J. Gupta).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

5,16-08-2022,DEEPIKA SINGH vs CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALC.A. No. 5308/2022,Right to avail of child-care for non-biological children.,"DEEPIKA SINGH V. CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL2022 INSC 834 (16 August 2022)Justices:  Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Ajjikuttira S. BopannaQuestion(s):  Whether, a woman who availed child-care leave for two non-biological children was entitled to maternity leave for her first biological child (deemed third child) under Rule 43 of Central Civil Service (Leave) Rules 1972.Factual Background:  The Appellant, employed as a Nursing Officer at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, married one Amir Singh, who already had two children from a previous marriage, a male child born on 1 February 2001 and a female child born on 3 March 2005. The Appellant gave birth to her first biological child on 4 June 2019 and applied for maternity leave in terms of Rule 43 of Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules 1972 (“Service Rules”). Her request for maternity leave was rejected by the authorities on the grounds that she had two surviving children from her spouse’s first marriage for whom she had already availed child care leave under Rule 43-C. Consequently, the child borne by her would be considered her third child, for which no maternity leave is allowed under Rule 43.According to Rule 43(1) of Service Rules, a female government employee “with less than two surviving children” is eligible for maternity leave for up to 180 days. Additionally, Rule 43-C allows a female government employee with minor children to seek child-care leave for a maximum duration of two years to attend to the needs of ""up to two children."" The Appellant challenged the rejection of her maternity leave before the Central Administrative Tribunal (“CAT”).The CAT rejected her challenge. The Appellant appealed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, but her appeal was dismissed. She then appealed to the Supreme Court.The Appellant contends that availing child-care leave would not disentitle her from availing subsequent maternity leave as they are distinct. The Respondents contend that having two surviving children disentitles her from availing maternity leave for what is effectively her third child.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court determined that the appellant's right to maternity leave for her biological child remains unaffected by the fact that her spouse had two children from his prior marriage whom she had availed child-care leave for. The appellant is entitled to maternity leave under Rule 43(1) for her first biological child. The judgment was authored by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Object of Rule 43 of Service RulesThe Supreme Court held that beneficial rules such as maternity benefits should be construed liberally to promote the intended objectives of social welfare (¶¶15-16). The Service Rules entrench and enhance the general non-discrimination principle of Article 15 of Constitution of India, and come from authority given in Article 15(3) of Constitution to create beneficial provisions for women (¶20).The Supreme Court examined similar provisions (under the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961) and held that the objective of these provisions is to ensure that an individual is not disentitled from being paid their wages during a period of leave for childbirth or child-care (¶19). The intention is to facilitate continued participation of women in the workforce (¶25). If a purposive interpretation of the legislation is not adopted, the object and intent of maternity leave would simply be defeated (¶25).Maternity Leave and Child-care are distinctThe Supreme Court observed that beyond the grant of 180 days maternity leave under Rule 43(1) of the Service Rules, women are entitled to child-care leave under Rule 43-C for the care of their two eldest surviving children, whether for rearing or addressing their needs such as education or sickness (¶23). This entitlement could be availed not only at the time of childbirth but also at any subsequent period. Both maternity leave and child care leave constitute distinct entitlements (¶23). Therefore, merely because the Appellant had availed child care leave did not disentitle her from claiming maternity leave (¶24).Atypical family units deserve equal benefitsThe Supreme Court opined that due to gendered roles assigned by society, women often undertake a disproportionate share of child-care (¶24). Atypical manifestations of family units (such as the present case) equally deserve benefits available under social welfare legislation (¶26). The Court reasoned that Appellant should not be denied maternity leave merely because she entered into a parent-child relationship or undertook child-care responsibilities in ways that may not find a place in the popular imagination (¶26).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

6,27-07-2022,VIJAY MADANLAL CHOUDHARY vs UNION OF INDIASLP(Crl) No. 4634/2014,"Constitutional challenge to provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.","VIJAY MADANLAL CHOUDHARY V. UNION OF INDIA2022 INSC 757 (27 July 2022)Justices:  Justice Ajay M. Khanwilkar, Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, Justice Chudalayil T. RavikumarQuestion(s):  (i) Are the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”) constitutional? (ii) Do the rules of investigation that apply to the police under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) apply to the Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) under the PMLA?Factual Background:  The PMLA was enacted in 2005 to fulfil India’s international commitment to tackling the issue of money laundering. The Act punishes the offence of money laundering and empowers investigative agencies to confiscate the proceeds of crime (i.e., criminal profits).Starting in 2014, several petitions and appeals were filed in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the PMLA. The Petitioners contended that the PMLA granted sweeping powers to the ED, the agency tasked with investigating complaints under it, and violated the fundamental rights of the accused. They argued that a 2019 amendment to the PMLA had expanded the scope of the offence of money laundering to those remotely connected with illegally obtained money. The Petitioners challenged Section 5, which empowers the ED to attach property involved in money laundering, Section 8, which empowers the ED to take possession of attached property, Sections 17 and 18 which allow the ED to carry out searches and seizures of accused persons, and Section 19, which grants the ED powers to arrest the accused without the registration of a formal complaint against them.The Petitioners also contended that Section 24, which sets out the burden of proof required by the PMLA, and Section 45, which determines when bail is granted under the Act, violate the presumption of innocence of the accused. Further, they argued that Section 50 allows the ED to extract self-incriminating statements from the accused, in violation of Article 20 of the Constitution. The Petitioners also contended that the amendments to the PMLA made by the Finance Act were illegally passed as “Money Bills'' under Article 110 of the Constitution. The Union of India defended the wide powers of the ED, arguing that they were necessary to prevent and punish money laundering.The Three-Judge Bench hearing the case clarified that it would not examine whether the amendments to the PMLA could be made through the Finance Act, since the issue of what exactly constitutes a “Money Bill” was pending consideration before a Seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  In a unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of each of the provisions of the PMLA under challenge. It found a person could be prosecuted for money laundering if they concealed, possessed, or used criminal profits, or if they represented these unlawful proceeds as lawful. The Court clarified that money laundering was not a standalone offence, and required the registration of an underlying criminal offence that generated profits. The Court held that since the PMLA was a self-contained code with its own safeguards, the provisions of the CrPC concerning investigation, search, and seizure were not applicable to the PMLA. The Court also upheld the PMLA’s placing the burden of proving that criminal profits were lawful property on the accused rather than the prosecution. The Court upheld restrictions on the right of the accused to avail bail on grounds that the restrictions were justifiable in light of the very serious offence of money laundering. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Khanwilkar.Reasons for the Decision:  Ingredients of money launderingThe Petitioners challenged the 2019 amendment to the PMLA which they contended expanded the scope of money laundering to those remotely connected with illegally obtained money. The Petitioners argued that representing property obtained as a result of criminal activity as clean or untainted property is the key element of the offence of money laundering. The Supreme Court relied on international covenants and the legislative intent behind the PMLA to reject this reading (¶39). The Court clarified that the offence of money laundering would extend to any involvement by a person with the proceeds of crime (i.e., criminal profits) (¶¶40, 42). This would include the concealment, possession, or the use of the proceeds of a crime. It held that the Petitioners’ reading would undermine the efficacy of the legislation (¶42). Given this interpretation, the Court held that the 2019 amendment which introduced an “Explanation” to Section 3 did not widen the scope of the offence, but was simply clarificatory in nature (¶¶40, 48).The Supreme Court found that the offence of money laundering was not a standalone offence and required the registration of an underlying criminal offence (referred to as a predicate offence or “scheduled offence” because of its enumeration in the Schedule of the PMLA) (¶55). The Court emphasised that an offence of money laundering could not be made out in the absence of proceeds of crime (defined in Section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA) generated from illegal activity related to the scheduled offence (¶52). No further steps for confiscation of the proceeds under Section 5 could be taken unless the ED had reason to believe a person was in possession of the proceeds, and this belief was supported by tangible and credible evidence (¶55).A self-contained codeThe Petitioners challenged Section 17 as unconstitutional on the ground of conferring drastic powers of search and seizure to the ED. The Petitioners argued that these drastic powers were exercisable in the absence of any safeguards, and even without the registration of a formal FIR or complaint in respect of the scheduled offence (¶77). The Supreme Court accepted the Union of India’s submission that the PMLA was a self-contained code, and highlighted Section 7 of the PMLA which states that its provisions will have effect regardless of inconsistent provisions in prevailing laws (¶78). The Court also cited Section 65 of the PMLA which states that the CrPC will apply only to the extent that it is consistent with the PMLA’s provisions in respect of arrest, search and seizure, attachment, confiscation, investigation, prosecution and other proceedings (¶78).The Supreme Court accepted the Union of India’s argument that the Enforcement Case Information Report (“ECIR”) was not a statutory document like a FIR, but an internal document of the ED (¶176). No provision in the PMLA required the ED to make an ECIR prior to attaching or confiscating property (¶177). Further, the Court found that it was not necessary for the ECIR to be furnished to a person apprehending arrest or even after his arrest, as long as he was informed about the grounds of his arrest in accordance with Article 22(1) of the Constitution (¶178).The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 24 of the PMLA, which places the burden of proving that alleged proceeds of crime are lawful property on the accused. The Court reasoned that the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, applicable in criminal trials, would not apply to civil attachment and confiscation proceedings before the ED or criminal proceedings before the Special Courts under the PMLA (¶92). It found that the presumption of innocence of the accused could be amended by Parliament and noted that other statutes (such as the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973) that shifted the burden of proof to the accused had been upheld by the Supreme Court (¶95). The Court held that considering that the accused may discharge the burden of proof by demonstrating no involvement in activities related to the proceeds of crime, Section 24 could not be held unconstitutional (¶96).The Supreme Court found that statements recorded by persons summoned by the ED under Section 50 were admissible evidence in criminal proceedings (¶). The Court held that since ED authorities were not police officers, the persons summoned were not the “accused,” and the summons, though called part of an investigation, were really more an inquiry to determine the commission of money laundering (¶172). The Court held that the protection of Article 20 against self-incrimination would only be attracted if a person’s statement were recorded after a formal arrest by the ED, since in such cases, they would be an “accused” under Article 20(3) (¶159, 172).Overturning Nikesh Tarachand Shah v. Union of IndiaThe Supreme Court overturned its decision in Nikesh Tarachand Shah v. Union of India (2017), in which a Division Bench (two judges) had held that the twin conditions for granting bail under Section 45 of the PMLA were unconstitutional. At the time, Section 45 provided that persons accused of an offence punishable with more than three years imprisonment would not be entitled to bail unless (i) there were reasonable grounds for believing they were not guilty, and (ii) they were not likely to commit an offence while on bail. The Division Bench in Nikesh Tarachand Shah found that limiting these twin conditions to a particular class of offences (punishable with more than three years imprisonment) was unjustifiable given the object of the PMLA (¶120). A 2018 amendment to the PMLA made these twin conditions applicable to all offences under the Act.In Vijay Madanlal, the Court reasoned that the amendment had cured the Section’s defects (¶121). Further, it held that the decision in Nikesh Tarachand which held that provisions similar to Section 45 had only been upheld when a compelling State interest in addressing extremely heinous crimes existed, was mistakenly based on the Court’s perception of Parliament, and that was beyond the scope of judicial review (¶129). While the Court acknowledged that Section 45 restricted the right of the accused to avail bail, it emphasised that the discretion vested in the Special Courts was not arbitrary but rationally connected to the object of combating the very serious, transnational offence of money laundering (¶¶133-135).Inbuilt SafeguardsThe Supreme Court also highlighted the multiple safeguards built into the PMLA (¶85). For example, for a search to be carried out, it was necessary for a high-ranking official to record their reasons for the search in writing (¶¶79-80, 83-84). A search undertaken in absence of such reasons would lead to punishments for the investigating officers under Section 62 of the Act (¶83).Prepared by Avanti DivanCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

7,21-07-2022,X vs THE PRINCIPAL SECRETARY HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE DEPARTMENT GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHIC.A. No. 5802/2022,Right of an unmarried woman to secure abortion after twenty weeks.,"X V. THE PRINCIPAL SECRETARY HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE DEPARTMENT GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI2022 INSC 740 (21 July 2022)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Surya Kant, and Justice Ajjikuttira S. BopannaQuestion(s):  Whether unmarried women can secure an abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy under Rule 3B of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules, 2003 (“MTP Rules”).Factual Background:  The appellant, a 25-year-old unmarried woman involved in a consensual relationship, found out that she was 22 weeks pregnant in July 2022. Subsequently, before she completed 24 weeks of pregnancy, she filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court seeking permission to terminate the pregnancy.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (“MTP Act”) allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks under Section 3(2)(a). Section 3(2)(b) of the Act allows for an abortion between 20-24 weeks if the pregnancy poses risks to the woman's life or mental health. However, MTP Rules state that such an abortion between 20-24 weeks is only allowed in certain cases like rape survivors, minors, women with changed marital status during pregnancy, mentally-ill women, or in cases of foetal malformation. Rule 3B(c) of the MTP Rules specifically permits termination between 20-24 weeks if there is a change in marital status during pregnancy (widowhood and divorce).In writ proceedings before the High Court of Delhi, the appellant argued that her partner had refused to marry her at the last stage, and that Rule 3B(c) was discriminatory for not permitting unmarried women to secure an abortion. On 15 July 2022, the High Court of Delhi denied the Appellant’s request to terminate her pregnancy, holding that as on the date of its order, Rule 3B of MTP Rules is only applicable to married women. The Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of India.Decision of the Supreme Court:  In its interim order, the Supreme Court modified the order of the Delhi High Court and granted the appellant permission to terminate her pregnancy under the MTP Act, subject to opinion of the Medical Board constituted under the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) that the pregnancy could be terminated without danger to the life of the Appellant.In its final judgment, the Court ruled that unmarried women can secure an abortion between 20-24 weeks under Rule 3B of the MTP Rules. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  The Supreme Court held that the phrase ‘change of marital status’ should be understood broadly, not restrictively, and the terms ‘widowhood and divorce’ should not be considered exhaustive (¶14).The Supreme Court noted that the 2021 amendment to the MTP Act aimed to include unmarried and single women by replacing the terms ‘married woman’ with the words ‘any woman’, and replacing ‘husband’ with ‘partner’ in Explanation I of Section 3(2). This change implies that the Act is not limited to married women (¶¶15-17).The Supreme Court further held that there is a gap in the law: while Section 3 of MTP Act extends beyond marital relationships, Rule 3B of the MTP Rules does not explicitly mention unmarried women. Nonetheless, the Court ruled that denying unmarried women the right to terminate pregnancy contradicts the principles of equality as the same right is available to other categories of women – such as divorcees, widows, minors, disabled and mentally ill women, and survivors of sexual assault or rape (¶18).Emphasizing that the MTP Act recognizes a woman's fundamental rights to reproductive choice, bodily integrity, and autonomy under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Court clarified that these rights are not confined to married women; both married and unmarried women have the right to decide on termination of pregnancy (¶16).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

No. 1599/2020,Enforceability of non-stamped arbitration agreements.,"IN RE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UNDER THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT 1996 AND THE INDIAN STAMP ACT 1899. V. 2023 INSC 1066 (13 December 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Surya Kant, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Whether an arbitration clause in an unstamped or inadequately stamped contract is enforceable?Factual Background:  In 2011, a Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court in SMS Tea Estates (P) Ltd. v. Chandmari Tea Co. (P) Ltd [2011 INSC 508] (“SMS Tea Estates”) held that an arbitration agreement in an unstamped contract is invalid. In February 2020, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Dharmaratnakara Rai Bahadur Arcot Narainswamy Mudaliar Chattram v. Bhaskar Raju and Brothers [2020 INSC 194] (“Bhaskar Raju”) followed this ruling in SMS Tea Estates with approval.In 2021, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court in N N Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. [2021 INSC 12] (“N N Global 1”) took a view contrary to SMS Tea Estates and held that non-stamping of the contract would not invalidate the arbitration agreement contained in it and the arbitration agreement can be acted upon. Given these conflicting decisions of the Court, a Constitution Bench (five judges) was set up to decide the issue.In December 2022, a curative petition (final remedy to reconsider a decision by the Supreme Court) was filed in the Supreme Court for reconsideration of the Bhaskar Raju decision. Before the curation petition was finally decided, in April 2023, a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court by a 3:2 majority in N N Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. v. Indo Unique Flame Ltd. [2023 INSC 423] (“N N Global 2”) held that N N Global 1 was incorrect and upheld the view taken in SMS Tea Estates. The Court held that an unstamped contract is void (does not have any legal effect) and hence, an arbitration clause in an unstamped contract is not enforceable.Later, while hearing the curative petition in Bhaskar Raju and considering the larger ramifications and consequences of the decision in N N Global 2 , the Supreme Court referred the case to a Seven-Judge Bench. The present case (In Re: Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under The Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 and The Indian Stamp Act 1899) is this reference to the Seven-Judge Bench to decide the correctness of the Constitution Bench decision in NN Global 2.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that that arbitration agreement or arbitration clause contained in an unstamped or inadequately stamped contract is valid and can be acted upon. The Court also held that a contract which is not stamped or is inadequately stamped is not void but is only inadmissible in evidence. The Court declared that the decisions in N N Global 2 and SMS Tea Estates were incorrect. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud. Justice Sanjiv Khanna wrote a separate concurring opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  The difference between inadmissibility and voidnessThe Supreme Court noted that a void agreement is unenforceable in a Court of law i.e. it cannot be given effect to, while an inadmissible document can merely not be introduced as evidence in a Court of law (¶44). The Court observed that while Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act 1899 (“Stamp Act”) makes an unstamped or inadequately stamped document inadmissible in evidence, non-stamping under the Stamp Act does not render the document void (¶48, ¶11 J. Khanna). The Court noted that the non-payment of stamp duty is a curable defect as the Stamp Act itself provides under Section 42(2) that once the required stamp-duty is paid, the instrument will become admissible in evidence (¶48). In contrast, the Court noted that there is no procedure by which a void agreement can be cured (¶48).Minimising Judicial InterferenceThe Supreme Court noted that one of the main objectives of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (“Arbitration Act”) is to minimise the supervisory role of courts in the arbitral process (¶74). Section 5 of Arbitration Act states that for matters covered by the Arbitration Act, no court can interfere unless the law explicitly allows for it. Section 5 shows the legislative intent of limiting judicial intervention during the arbitral process (¶75). Section 8 of the Arbitration Act mandates courts to refer the parties to arbitration if there is prima facie a valid arbitration agreement (¶136). When referring parties to arbitration, the court cannot conduct a mini-trial by allowing parties to produce evidence regarding validity of an arbitration agreement (¶155). Section 11 of the Arbitration Act deals with the appointment of arbitrators, Section 11 allows intervention by courts only when parties fail to appoint an arbitrator (¶139). Section 11(6A) inserted by Arbitration Amendment Act of 2015 states that while appointing an arbitrator, the Court shall confine itself to the examination of existence of an arbitration agreement (¶144). The Court found that the intention of the legislature in adding Section 11(6A) was to limit the scope of the referral court’s jurisdiction to only one aspect – the existence of an arbitration agreement (¶145).The doctrine of competence-competenceThe Supreme Court noted that the doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz (also known as competence competence) states that arbitrators are empowered to decide on their own jurisdiction (¶115). The doctrine of competence-competence allows the arbitrators to decide on all issues arising out of the underlying contract, including the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement (¶116). Enshrining the competence-competence principle in Indian arbitration law, Section 16 of the Arbitration Act empowers the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of arbitration agreement (¶120, ¶28 J. Khanna).The Court noted that once the arbitrators decide a matter, Section 34 of the Arbitration Act allows applications for setting aside arbitral decisions. The Court noted that one of the grounds on which an arbitral award can be set aside is that the arbitration agreement is not valid under law. This indicates that the Arbitration Act does not contemplate the court determining the validity of an arbitration agreement before the arbitrators have had a chance to decide the issue first (¶121).Justice Khanna in his separate opinion held that an objection related to insufficient stamping or non-stamping of the underlying contract can be decided by the arbitrators (¶1 J. Khanna).Arbitration Act’s silence on stamp dutyThe Supreme Court noted that the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code and hence, provisions of other laws cannot interfere with the working of the Arbitration Act, unless the Act specifically allows for it (¶85). The Court noted that Parliament was aware of the Stamp Act when it enacted the Arbitration Act, yet, the Arbitration does not specify stamping as a pre-condition to the existence of a valid arbitration agreement (¶177).Intent and Purpose of Stamp ActThe Court noted that the Stamp Act is a fiscal legislation to protect the interests of revenue for the government (¶59), it is not intended to arm litigants with a weapon of technicality by which they can delay the resolution of a case (¶60, ¶19 J. Khanna).The Court held that the arbitrators will be bound by the Stamp Act and will have authority to enforce the provisions of the Stamp Act (¶184). The Court declared that this interpretation of the law ensures that the provisions of the Arbitration Act are given effect to while not detracting from the purpose of the Stamp Act (¶194).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

2,11-12-2023,IN RE ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION vs W.P.(C) No. 1099/2019,Challenge to the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution.,"IN RE ARTICLE 370 OF THE CONSTITUTION V. 2023 INSC 1058 (11 December 2023)Justices:   Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, and Justice Surya Kant Question(s):   Is the Union of India’s abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India and the bifurcation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories constitutional?Factual Background:   Prior to 1947, the territory of Jammu and Kashmir (“J&K”) was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh. When India gained independence in 1947, J&K had to choose whether to join the Dominion of India or the Dominion of Pakistan. Faced with a military threat from Pakistan, Maharaja Hari Singh joined the Dominion of India by signing an Instrument of Accession in 1947. In June 1949, the Maharaja transferred his power to Yuvraj Karan Singh. In November 1949, Yuvraj Karan Singh made a proclamation that the upcoming Constitution of India would govern the constitutional relationship between J&K and India. When the Constitution of India was adopted, J&K was included as a State in the Constitution. However, the entire Indian Constitution did not apply to J&K. In 1957, the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir prepared and adopted the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir (“J&K Constitution”). The relationship between the Indian Government and J&K was set out in Article 370. Article 370(1) allowed the Indian Parliament to make laws for J&K subject to the “consultation” or “concurrence” of the J&K State Government. Article 370(3) allowed for the abolition of Article 370 and the entire Indian Constitution to apply to J&K if the President passed a “Constitutional Order” (“C.O.”) on the recommendation of the J&K Constituent Assembly. However, the J&K Constituent Assembly was dissolved after it adopted the J&K Constitution, and no recommendation was made for the removal of Article 370.   In June 2018, the Chief Minister of J&K resigned and in November 2018, the Governor dissolved the Legislative Assembly of J&K. One month later, President’s Rule was imposed in J&K under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution. Under President’s Rule, the governance of the State was transferred to the President of India and the Indian Parliament. In August 2019, the President issued C.O. 272 which applied all the provisions of the Indian Constitution to J&K. C.O. 272 also stated that Article 370 could be removed on the recommendation of the “State Legislature” instead of the J&K Constituent Assembly. The President then issued C.O. 273 which abolished Article 370 on the recommendation of Parliament (acting as the State Legislature of J&K due to the imposition of President’s Rule in the State). Finally, Parliament passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 (“J&K Reorganisation Act”) which bifurcated the State of J&K into two Union Territories, the Union Territory of J&K, and the Union Territory of Ladakh. The Petitioners challenged the constitutionality of C.O. 272, C.O. 273, and the J&K Reorganisation Act. Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Supreme Court rejected the petitions and upheld the abolition of Article 370 and the reorganisation of the State of J&K into two Union Territories. The Judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud. Justice Sanjay K. Kaul and Justice Sanjiv Khanna wrote separate concurring opinions. The Supreme Court found that Article 370 was a “temporary” provision enacted until the special circumstances facing J&K were resolved. The Court held the President could not use a Constitutional Order to indirectly amend the Constitution to make the removal of Article 370 conditional on the recommendation of the State Legislature instead of the J&K Constituent Assembly. But it also found that the “recommendation” of the J&K Constituent Assembly under Article 370(3) would never have been binding on the President of India, who always had the power to remove Article 370. After the dissolution of the J&K Constituent Assembly, the President could abolish Article 370 whenever the President thought appropriate. The Court also held that the passage of the J&K Reorganisation Act did not violate the procedure for the reorganisation of States in Article 3. The Government of India stated that the Union Territory of J&K would be made a State again, and thus the Court did not decide the legality of converting the State of J&K into two Union Territories. The Court directed that elections to the Legislative Assembly for the Union Territory of J&K be held by 30 September 2024. Reasons for the Decision:   Kashmiri sovereignty The Supreme Court held that after Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession and Yuvraj Karan Singh made the proclamation stating that the Constitution of India will govern the constitutional relationship between J&K and India, J&K became an integral part of India with no separate sovereignty (¶141). The Court also noted that Section 3 of the J&K Constitution said that J&K was an integral part of India and Section 3 could never be changed by the State Government of J&K (¶149). Thus, while the J&K Constitution and Article 370 gave J&K extra “autonomy”, it was still a State under the Indian Constitution (¶164).The separate opinion of Justice Kaul found that the State of Jammu and Kashmir retained sovereignty due to the J&K Constitution (¶51 J. Kaul)Temporary nature of Article 370The Supreme Court found that Article 370 was originally passed as a temporary measure till the “special circumstances” in the State ended and the J&K Constituent Assembly was formed (¶278). Article 370 was included in Part XXI of the Constitution called “Temporary and Transitional provision” with other temporary articles (¶279-280). Further, the “marginal note” next to Article 370 said “temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir” (¶308).Difference between Constituent Assembly and State LegislatureThe Supreme Court found that one paragraph of C.O. 272 was unconstitutional because it tried to indirectly amend Article 370. Paragraph 4 of C.O. 272 stated that instead of the J&K Constituent Assembly giving a recommendation to the President to abolish Article 370, the State Legislature could make the same recommendation. The Court held that a State Legislature and a Constituent Assembly are very different, one passes laws and the other creates a constitution (¶384, 389). Thus, by trying to replace “Constituent Assembly” with “State Legislature”, paragraph 4 of C.O. 272 was an indirect and unconstitutional attempt to amend the Constitution (¶390). President’s power to abolish Article 370However, the Supreme Court held that the President of India retained the power to unilaterally abolish Article 370 even after the J&K Constituent Assembly ceased to exist. Article 370(3) required the “recommendation” of the J&K Constituent Assembly to abolish Article 370 entirely. The Court found that while “concurrence” meant the J&K State Government had to agree with the Indian Government, “recommendation” only required the view of the J&K Constituent Assembly be forwarded to the President under Article 370(3) (¶318). Thus, the “recommendation” of the J&K Constituent Assembly would never have been binding on the President (¶346). The J&K Constituent Assembly was dissolved after adopting the J&K Constitution, but the President retained the power to abolish Article 370 whenever the “special circumstances” in J&K ended and the President thought it was appropriate (¶354). The Court held that it can only review the President’s decision to abolish Article 370 if it was made in bad faith, which it was not (¶430).The Supreme Court held the President did not need to consult the J&K State Government to apply the entire Indian Constitution to J&K (¶427). It held that consultation was only necessary where some parts of the Indian Constitution were being applied to J&K, and careful amendments had to be made to the Constitution of J&K (¶427). But because the whole Indian Constitution was being applied to J&K in 2019, and the Constitution of J&K was being replaced entirely by the Indian Constitution, no consultation was necessary (¶428). After the whole Indian Constitution was applied to J&K, the Constitution of J&K is inoperative (¶470).Consequences of President’s Rule in Jammu & KashmirThe decision of nine-Judges in S.R. Bommai v. Union of India had already held that the President’s decision to impose Article 356 in a State (President’s Rule) was subject to judicial review (¶189). The Petitioners argued that Article 370 could not be repealed during the imposition of President’s Rule in J&K. The Court rejected this argument and stated that  government action under President’s Rule cannot be rejected merely because it has an irreversible impact (¶218). However, the Court also held that the actions taken during the imposition of President’s Rule were subject to judicial review on the grounds that they were made in bad faith or had no connection with the reasons for imposing President’s Rule (¶208). However, actions pertaining to the everyday administration of a State during President’s Rule cannot be challenged (¶207).                      Reorganisation of State into two Union Territories Article 3 of the Constitution allows Parliament to change the boundaries of States by passing a law. However, any law made under Article 3 (such as the J&K Reorganisation Act) must be sent to the affected States to seek its views. The Supreme Court found that the passage of the J&K Reorganisation Act did not violate Article 3 because: (i) the views of a State on any reorganisation act are not binding (¶511); (ii) the requirement to seek the J&K’s views was suspended due to the imposition of President’s Rule in J&K (¶506); and (iii) Parliament, acting as the legislature of J&K during the imposition of President’s Rule had agreed to the J&K Reorganisation Act (¶511). The Court held that during President’s Rule, Parliament can not only pass laws on behalf of a State, but also perform other constitutional functions for the State such as approving re-organisation acts (¶227-228).    The Supreme Court observed that Article 3 of the Constitution gave Parliament the right to create a Union Territory out of the land of a State. Thus, the Court upheld the creation of the Union Territory of Ladakh (¶503). On the question of whether Parliament can extinguish a State and create two Union Territories, the Court recorded the Government of India’s statement that the Union Territory of J&K would be made a State again soon (¶503). Given this assurance, the Court held there was no need to decide whether a State could be converted into a Union Territory (¶503). The Court directed that elections should be held in the Union Territory of J&K by 30 September 2024 (¶503). The separate opinion of Justice Khanna noted that converting a State into a Union Territory interferes with federalism and should only be done for compelling reasons (¶6 J. Khanna).Prepared by Vasudev DevadasanCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Materials:   Day 1 of Arguments: 11 July 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)  Day 2 of Arguments: 02 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 3 of Arguments: 03 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 4 of Arguments: 08 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 5 of Arguments: 09 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 6 of Arguments: 10 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 7 of Arguments: 16 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 8 of Arguments: 17 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 9 of Arguments: 22 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 10 of Arguments: 23 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 11 of Arguments: 24 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 12 of Arguments: 28 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 13 of Arguments: 29 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 14 of Arguments: 31 August 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 15 of Arguments: 01 September 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 16 of Arguments: 04 September 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)Day 17 of Arguments: 05 September 2023 (Argument Transcripts) | (Video Recording)"
3,06-12-2023,COX AND KINGS LTD. vs SAP INDIA PVT. LTD.ARBIT. PETITION No. 38/2020,When parties who have not signed an arbitration agreement can nonetheless be made party to an arbitration.,"COX AND KINGS LTD. V. SAP INDIA PVT. LTD.2023 INSC 1051 (6 December 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Pamidighantam S. Narasimha, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  (i) Can parties who have not signed a contract be made parties to an arbitration concerning that contract? If yes, then under what circumstances can they be made parties? (ii) Whether the Group of Companies Doctrine (“GoC Doctrine”) is valid and applicable in Indian arbitration law.Factual Background:  In December 2020, the Petitioner (Cox and Kings Limited) entered into a Software Licensing Agreement with SAP India Private Limited (“SAP India”). Under the Agreement, the Petitioner was made a licensee of software which was developed and owned by SAP India.In 2015, while the Petitioner was in the process of developing its own e-commerce platform, SAP India recommended its software, Hybris Solution to the Petitioner. Three new agreements were entered into by the two companies, one of which was the ‘General Terms and Conditions Agreement’ containing an Arbitration Clause.Encountering difficulties in implementing the software, the Petitioner sought assistance from SAP SE, the parent company of SAP India based in Germany. However, the project faced setbacks and was eventually terminated by the Petitioner in November 2016. The Petitioner demanded a refund of ?45 crore. In response, SAP India claimed wrongful termination and demanded ?17 crore. The Petitioner sent notices to initiate arbitration to both SAP India and SAP SE. However, SAP SE was not a signatory to any of the agreements.SAP India did not appoint an arbitrator. Subsequently, the Petitioner approached the Supreme Court seeking the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Arbitration Act”). The Petitioner contended that SAP SE, by assuming full responsibility for the project, implicitly consented to be bound by the agreement. Moreover, SAP India was entirely owned by SAP SE. This legal concept of incorporating a non-signatory into an arbitration agreement is recognized as the Group of Companies Doctrine. Given the importance of the legal issue, the Three-Judge bench of the Supreme Court referred the case to a Constitution Bench (five judges).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court affirmed the validity of the Group of Companies Doctrine in Indian arbitration law, ruling that companies within a corporate group, even if not explicit signatories to an arbitration agreement, could be bound by the agreement. Regarding exactly when non-signatories may be bound, the Court ruled that such determinations should be left to the competence of arbitral tribunals on a case-to-case basis. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, with Justice P. S. Narasimha authoring a concurring opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  Non-signatories can be party to an arbitration agreementThe Supreme Court explained that while the primary approach to identify parties in an arbitration is to look at the signatories to the arbitration agreement, this does not preclude non-signatories from being considered as parties to the arbitration (¶66 J. Chandrachud). Even parties that have not signed an arbitration agreement can demonstrate their intention and consent to enter into a legal relationship and be bound by the arbitration agreement through other actions (¶¶66-67 J. Chandrachud). The test lies in assessing whether these non-signatories intended to establish legal relations with the parties of the arbitration agreement (¶66 J. Chandrachud, ¶14 J. Narasimha).The Supreme Court held that while a written arbitration agreement is mandatory, the form of recording is irrelevant (¶78 J. Chandrachud, ¶15(ii) J. Narasimha). Under section 7 of the Arbitration Act, an agreement is considered in writing when parties formally sign it, when there is documented evidence of their consent, or when an exchange of claims and defence acknowledges its existence (¶¶71-73 J. Chandrachud). The Court clarified that the common goal in these circumstances is to ascertain the parties' mutual intention to be bound by the arbitration agreement (¶73 J. Chandrachud, ¶¶10-15 J. Narasimha). Being a signatory is not necessary. (¶76 J. Chandrachud).Group of Companies Doctrine applicable in IndiaThe Supreme Court defined ‘group of companies’ as a set of privately and publicly owned firms in different businesses (¶82 J. Chandrachud). Even though each firm is an independent legal entity, they all follow a common authority, and are linked by trust-based relationships (¶82 J. Chandrachud).The GoC Doctrine allows a non-signatory company within a ‘group of companies’ to either benefit from or be bound by an arbitration agreement made by its affiliated companies (¶98 J. Chandrachud, ¶38 J. Narasimha). This applies when circumstances indicate that all parties, both signatories and non-signatories, intended to be bound by the agreement (¶98 J. Chandrachud, ¶38 J. Narasimha). The GoC Doctrine takes a practical approach, consolidating all closely connected parties in a single forum, which is especially useful in disputes involving multiple agreements and parties (¶97 J. Chandrachud). Furthermore, the Court clarified that the existence of ‘group of companies’ is a question of fact, which courts have to assess (¶102 J. Chandrachud).The Supreme Court ruled that the following factors must be considered when applying this doctrine: (i) mutual intent of the parties (ii) the relationship of the non-signatory to the party which is a signatory to the agreement (iii) commonality of subject-matter (iv) composite nature of the transaction, and (v) performance of the contract (¶¶110-111 J. Chandrachud, ¶40 J. Narasimha).The Supreme Court held that to involve a non-signatory, a party must present strong evidence demonstrating the conscious and deliberate participation of the non-signatory (¶122 J. Chandrachud). Simply showing that the companies work together as a single economic unit isn’t sufficient; they must actively collaborate on a common project (¶¶113-114 J. Chandrachud). Furthermore, the Court opined that the GoC Doctrine exists independently in the Indian arbitration law, based on the principle of the mutual intent of parties in an agreement (¶165(g) J. Chandrachud, ¶50, ¶54 J. Narasimha).Standard of determination by court at referral stageThe Supreme Court explained that Section 8 of the Arbitration Act requires the court to conduct a preliminary check to assess if the arbitration agreement is valid, and Section 11 allows the Supreme Court and High Courts to appoint arbitrators if the parties don't follow the agreed procedure of appointment (¶154 J. Chandrachud).The court will decide on the agreement's validity and the parties involved in two situations: first, when a signatory wants to include a non-signatory to arbitration, and second, when the non-signatory itself wants to join (¶164 J. Chandrachud). However, for complex deals, it's better for arbitral tribunals, not the court, to decide if a non-signatory is really part of the arbitration agreement. This aligns with Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, which allows the tribunal to decide its own authority (¶164 J. Chandrachud).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

4,10-11-2023,THE STATE OF PUNJAB vs PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNOR OF PUNJABW.P.(C) No. 1224/2023,Whether a Governor can withhold action on a Bill and power of the Speaker to reconvene the session of the legislative assembly.,"THE STATE OF PUNJAB V. PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNOR OF PUNJAB2023 INSC 1017 (10 November 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MishraQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the Governor can withhold action on bills which have been passed by the State Legislature. (ii) Whether it is permissible for the Speaker to reconvene a Legislative Assembly session which has been adjourned sine die but has not been prorogued.Factual Background:  On 22 February 2023, the Council of Ministers of the Government of Punjab forwarded a recommendation to the Governor of Punjab seeking the summoning of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha for its Budget Session commencing on 3 March 2023. The Governor refused to do so, on the ground that he was seeking legal advice. This led to the first round of litigation between the State of Punjab and the Governor of Punjab. Following the decision of the Supreme Court on 28 February 2023, he summoned the assembly and the Budget session was convened on 3 March 2023.The Budget session of the Punjab Legislative Assembly was adjourned sine die (dismissed for an unspecified period) by the Speaker on 23 March 2023. The Assembly was reconvened and four bills were passed on 19 and 20, June 2023. The Governor expressed his doubt on the legitimacy of these bills and stated that the calling of the session was illegal, against the accepted procedures and practice of the legislature, and against the provisions of the Constitution.The inaction by the Governor of Punjab regarding the four bills led to the present second round of the litigation. The Governor had neither assented to these bills nor were they returned when the petition was admitted by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2023.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Three-Judge-Bench of the Supreme Court allowed the petition and held that the Governor cannot withhold action indefinitely on bills which have been passed by the State Legislature. The Court also ruled that the Speaker can reconvene a session of the Legislative Assembly which has not been prorogued. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  No power to withhold assent indefinitelyThe Supreme Court referred to Article 200, which states that the Governor must either assent to the bill or return it to the legislature “as soon as possible”. The Court held that the expression “as soon as possible” has a significant constitutional content and describes the expedient manner in which the Governor must act once a bill is passed (¶24). Not taking action on bills for indefinite periods of time is inconsistent with the phrase “as soon as possible” and the mandate of Article 200. The Constitution contains this language bearing in mind the importance attached to the power of legislation which squarely lies in the domain of the state legislature. (¶24).The Supreme Court ruled that if the Governor decides to withhold assent under Article 200, the logical course of action is to return the bill to the state legislature for reconsideration (¶25).Reconvening of assembly after adjournment sine die is permissibleThe Supreme Court also held that Rule 16 of the Rules of Procedure of the Punjab Legislative Assembly recognises a situation where the Speaker reconvenes a sitting of the Legislative Assembly which has been adjourned sine die but not prorogued (¶34). It referred to Ramdas Athawale v. Union of India (2010 INSC 177) in which it was held that an adjournment is an interruption in the course of one and the same session, whereas a prorogation terminates a session.The Court observed that established legislative practice across various legislative assemblies in the country distinguished between an adjournment sine die and prorogation of the session of the House. Therefore, the Speaker was empowered to reconvene the Punjab Legislative Assembly as it had only been adjourned and not prorogued (¶37).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

5,30-10-2023,MANISH SISODIA vs CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONCrl.A. No. 3352/2023,Bail application filed by Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi.,"MANISH SISODIA V. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION2023 INSC 956 (30 October 2023)Justices:  Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sarasa V. N. BhattiQuestion(s):  Whether Manish Sisodia (“Appellant”) is entitled to bail.Factual Background:  The Appellant was the former Deputy Chief Minister and Excise Minister of Delhi. He was arrested and taken into custody by the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) and the Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) on 26 February 2023 and 9 March 2023 respectively, in connection with an investigation pertaining to the Delhi Liquor Excise Policy 2021-22 (“Excise Policy”).The CBI filed two chargesheets which charged the Appellant for offences under Sections 201 (disappearing evidence) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”) and Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 (taking and offering a bribe) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (“PCA”). The ED filed a criminal complaint accusing the Appellant of money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”).The crux of the allegations was that the Appellant had abused his authority as a public servant by formulating a new Liquor Excise Policy for Delhi which favoured certain wholesale distributors in return for bribes and kickbacks to the Appellant and his associates. It was contended by the CBI and ED that these bribes amounted to around Rupees One Hundred Crores and the same was laundered and used by the Appellant in support of his political party.The Appellant had been denied bail in both the cases (that of the CBI and of the ED) by the Trial Court and the High Court of Delhi. The Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court seeking bail.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court refused to grant bail to the Appellant in light of the serious allegations in the chargesheet filed by the ED regarding the offences under the PMLA that the Court found were tentatively supported by evidence. However, the Court unequivocally stated that the Court found all disputed factual and legal issues were left open and will be decided in trial before the Trial Court. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Khanna.The Supreme Court gave the Appellant the freedom to file a fresh bail application in case there was a change in circumstances or if the trial proceeded slowly over the next three months. The Court also allowed the Appellant to file interim bail applications in case of any medical or personal or family emergency.Reasons for the Decision:  Legal Principles to be followed for Grant of Bail under the PMLAThe Supreme Court referred to the case of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India [2022 INSC 757] (“Vijay Madanlal”) where the standard of granting bail under the PMLA was clarified (¶8). According to Vijay Madanlal, in order to grant bail, a court need not give detailed reasons or examine the evidence in detail but must arrive at a tentative finding on reasonable grounds that the accused is not guilty of an offence under the PMLA (¶8). The Court followed the mandate laid down by Vijay Madanlal in deciding the present bail application (¶9).Grounds for Refusal to Grant Bail to the AppellantThe Supreme Court observed that the allegations in the ED’s criminal complaint concerning illegal gains due to changes brought about by the Excise Policy was tentatively supported by the facts and evidence (¶21). Specifically, this pertained to the fact that certain wholesale distributors had allegedly made exorbitant profits at the expense of the government exchequer and the general public under the new Excise Policy (¶21).Additional ObservationsThe Supreme Court highlighted its concern regarding the long period of incarceration undergone by the Appellant (¶26). Emphasizing that the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Court clarified that an accused should not have to wait until he had undergone imprisonment for the specified period of the offence he is charged with before being granted bail under the PMLA (¶26).The Supreme Court also relied on the assurance by the CBI that the trial would be concluded within six to eight months and said that if the case was not decided within this time, then the Appellant may be granted bail (¶28). The Court further noted that if the trial was proceeding slowly after three months, the Appellant could re-apply for bail (¶29).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

6,20-10-2023,DR. BALRAM SINGH vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 324/2020,Directions to secure the elimination of manual scavenging.,"DR. BALRAM SINGH V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 950 (20 October 2023)Justices:  Justice Shripathi R. Bhat, Justice Aravind KumarQuestion(s):  A petition seeking implementation of Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993 (“Manual Scavengers Employment Act, 1993”) and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (“Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act, 2013”).Factual Background:  A petition was filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, seeking directions to the Respondents (Union of India and all the States and Union Territories) to implement provisions of the Manual Scavengers Employment Act, 1993 and Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The Manual Scavengers Employment Act, 1993 was enacted to prohibit the employment of manual scavengers and the construction of dry latrines. The Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act, 2013 was enacted to provide for the rehabilitation of individuals previously engaged in manual scavenging.The Petitioner claims that despite these legislations, manual scavenging continues due to the Respondents' failure to implement essential provisions of these statutes such as failure to conduct surveys for identification of manual scavengers in all districts. The Petitioner sought a blanket ban on manual scavenging while simultaneously ensuring adequate rehabilitation and employment opportunities for those involved in these practices.The Respondent contended that the Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act, 2013 does not mandate a nationwide survey of manual scavengers by the Union Government. Instead, it requires localized surveys by local bodies. It was highlighted that the government incurred an expenditure of approximately ten crore for conducting a survey in 2013, followed by payment of compensation to identified manual scavengers of approximately 55 crores.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court directed the Union Government to ensure phased eradication of manual sewer cleaning, by developing policies and issuing directives to all relevant bodies, including corporations, railways, cantonments, and agencies under its jurisdiction. Additionally, it should provide essential guidelines to ensure that outsourced sewer cleaning tasks do not necessitate individuals entering sewers for any reason.State Governments were directed to align their policies with Union guidelines, providing comprehensive rehabilitation measures for sewage workers and their families. The Court highlighted the need for a significant increase in compensation for sewer deaths and disabilities, alongside mechanisms for contractor accountability. The compensation amount for sewer deaths was raised to thirty lakhs. Additionally, the Court instructed the establishment of educational scholarships for victims' dependents and the coordination of legal authorities in policy implementation. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Bhat.Reasons for the Decision:  Emancipatory nature of ActThe Supreme Court observed that the Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act, 2013 was enacted to advance Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 15, 17, 23 and 24 of the Constitution of India, to shift away from oppressive societal structures towards dignified employment (¶9). Section 11(7) read with section 6(2) of the Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act, 2013 liberates individuals from practice of manual scavenging (¶49). The Act must therefore be interpreted to promote fraternity and assure the dignity of the individual (¶49).Insufficiency of the Surveys/Inaccuracy of DataThe Supreme Court highlighted that the data collected from surveys in 2013, 2018, and later years has inconsistencies and contradictions, undermining the credibility of the surveys (¶¶57- 58). The failure to identify manual scavengers servicing insanitary latrines, as evidenced by data from Cantonment Boards, highlights the shortcomings of the surveys in capturing the true extent of manual scavenging (¶63). Furthermore, the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis has consistently raised concerns about the accuracy of data on manual scavengers since 2015-16, indicating a lack of reliable figures and the need for authentic data collection (¶64).Non-constitution of Committees and InstitutionsThe Supreme Court held that institutional shortcomings, such as the non-constitution and non-functioning of key bodies mandated by the 2013 Act, including the State Commissions, hinder effective implementation of the Act (¶¶67-69). The Central Monitoring Committee, tasked with coordinating and monitoring implementation efforts, has failed to meet regularly (¶74). Vigilance Committees, crucial for overseeing rehabilitation efforts and monitoring compliance, are either non-existent or non-functional in many states (¶¶77-78).The Court held that the failure to constitute Survey Committees at the state and district levels impedes the conducting of comprehensive surveys to identify manual scavengers and formulating effective rehabilitation plans (¶79).Wider outlook for RehabilitationThe Supreme Court held that the first step towards rehabilitation is identifying manual scavengers through a real and undisputable survey (¶¶51-52). Economic measures alone are not sufficient for upliftment of the family; rehabilitation demands a combination of both long-term and short-term socio-economic measures like scholarships (¶94).Prepared by Hiteshi Sharma (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

7,17-10-2023,SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 1011/2022,Whether members of the LGBTQIA+ community have a right to marriage.,"SUPRIYO @ SUPRIYA CHAKRABORTY V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 920 (17 October 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Shripathi R. Bhat, Justice Hima Kohli, Justice Pamidighantam S. NarasimhaQuestion(s):  (i) Do members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (“LGBTQIA+”) community have a right to marriage? If yes, then can the Supreme Court of India make a declaration to this effect? (ii) Does the non-inclusion of LGBTQIA+ marriages under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, amount to unconstitutional discrimination under Article 14 of Constitution of India? (iii) Do members of the LGBTQIA+ community have a right to form civil unions, and does the State have a corresponding duty to legally recognise such civil unions?Factual Background:  Two same-sex couples filed writ petitions in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of Constitution of India seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages. The Petitioners argued that Section 4(c) of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 (“SMA”), which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, was unconstitutional because it discriminates against same-sex couples, denying them essential benefits of marriage. This includes opportunities such as adoption and surrogacy and benefits under succession laws and insurance policies. The Petitioners contended that by not recognising same-sex marriage, the Government was infringing their fundamental right to equality, freedom of expression, and human dignity.The Union of India (Respondents) argued that marriage is a social institution which flows from tradition, personal law, and religion and needs social acceptability, and only heterosexual marriages have such acceptability. The Union of India argued that the Constitution does not recognize a fundamental right to marry. Further, the SMA is not discriminatory, as Parliament never contemplated including non-heterosexual unions during its enactment. Further, the Union argued that interpreting the SMA to cover non-hetrosexual couples would lead to absurd and unworkable results and impact various other statutes related to adoption, succession, surrogacy, and maintenance which all contemplated as a union between a man and a woman. Only Parliament has the authority to bring about such a change. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) wrote four opinions. All five Judges found that there is no fundamental right to marry under the Constitution. All five Judges further held that the Special Marriage Act, 1954 allows marriage only between a male and a female and cannot be interpreted to cover non-hetrosexual marriages as this would amount to an extensive re-writing of the law beyond the role of the Court. However, the Court did not strike down the SMA as unconstitutional.A majority of three judges (Chief Justice Chandrachud, Justice Bhat, and Justice Kohli) expressly stated that transgender persons in heterosexual relationships as well as Intersex persons who identify as either male or female have the right to marry under existing law.By a 3:2 majority, the Supreme Court held that non-heterosexual couples do not have the right to enter into a civil union unless the legislature changes the laws. This 3:2 majority further held that unmarried couples (including queer/non-heterosexual couples) do not have the right to jointly adopt a child under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (“JJ Act”). The opinions of Justice Bhat (joined by Justice Kohli) and Justice Narasimha formed the majority opinion of the Court on these issues.The minority found that non-hetrosexual couples have a right to enter into a civil union. The minority found that a failure to recognise civil unions would violate Article 15 of the Constitution. The minority further interpreted Section 57 of the JJ Act to allow unmarried couples to adopt and consequently struck down Regulation 5(3) of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (“CARA”) Adoption Regulation, which limits adoption only to single individuals and married couples who are in a stable marital relationship. The opinions of Justice Chandrachud and Justice Kaul constituted the minority opinion of the Court.The Supreme Court acknowledged that members of the LGBTQIA+ community faced a variety of legal disadvantages and directed the Union Government to constitute a committee chaired by the Union Cabinet Secretary to set out the rights and benefits queer couples in civil unions would be entitled to.Reasons for the Decision:  No fundamental right to marryThe Supreme Court found that the Constitution does not expressly recognize a fundamental right to marry (¶185 J. Chandrachud, ¶50 J.Bhat, ¶4 J. Narasimha, ¶3 J. Kaul). It pointed out that the laws relating to the institution of marriage are enacted by the Parliament (¶¶182-183 J. Chandrachud, ¶¶45-47 J. Bhat, ¶4 J. Narasimha, ¶3 J. Kaul). However, the Court found that the institution of marriage cannot be elevated to the realm of a fundamental right based on the importance people accord to it or the content of marriage laws (¶340 J. Chandrachud, ¶49 J. Bhat). As the right to marry is a personal preference which confers social status, it is not an enforceable right which courts can compel the government to provide (¶49 J. Bhat).SMA cannot be interpreted to cover same-sex marriagesAll five judges held that reading gender-specific terms in the SMA (e.g., “man” and “woman” or “bride” and “bridegroom”) gender neutrally (to mean “spouse”) to allow same sex marriages would involve rewriting the law, which was the role of Parliament and not the Court (¶208 J. Chandrachud, ¶103 J. Bhat, ¶4 J. Narasimha, ¶3 J. Kaul). The Court noted that various provisions of the SMA specifically referred to ‘men’ and ‘women’ and treated them differently (e.g., specifying different legal ages for marriage and different rights on issues of divorce, maintenance, and inheritance) (¶¶190-191 J. Chandrachud, ¶101 J. Bhat). Thus, applying the SMA to same-sex couples would lead to numerous complications when applying the gender-specific provisions of the law (¶102 J. Bhat, ¶4 J. Narasimha, ¶17 J. Kaul).None of the judges struck down the SMA as unconstitutional. Chief Justice Chandrachud declined to strike down the SMA as this would make it impossible for interfaith couples to marry under Indian law and defeat the SMA’s progressive intent (¶207 J. Chandrachud). Justice Kaul found that the SMA’s failure to provide for same-sex marriage was discriminatory but did not strike it down for the same reasons as the Chief Justice (¶18 J. Kaul). Justice Bhat held that the SMA was not discriminatory solely because it failed to provide for non-hetrosexual marriages, noting that homosexuality itself was criminalised when the SMA was enacted in 1954 (¶82, ¶85 J. Bhat).No legal recognition for civil unions of LGBTQIA+ couplesAll five judges held that queer persons have the right to relationships and choice of partners under Article 21 (¶233 J. Chandrachud, ¶70 J. Bhat). However, a majority of three judges (Justices Bhat, Kohli, and Narasimha) did not recognise a right for non-hetrosexual couples to form legally recognised civil unions (¶70 J. Bhat, ¶16 J. Narasimha). They noted that recognising civil unions would involve creating a separate legal framework for such unions, including registration, eligibility, age restrictions, and other rights related to marriage, which is beyond the power of the Court (¶69 J. Bhat). Justice Narasimha, concurring with Justice Bhat, added that mandating the state to recognize civil unions could violate the doctrine of separation of powers (¶17 J.Narasimha).However, Chief Justice Chandrachud and Justice Kaul (in the minority) ruled that queer couples have the right to enter into a civil union and the State has a corresponding duty to recognise such unions (¶340(i) J. Chandrachud, ¶11 J. Kaul). This right falls under Articles 19 and 25, encompassing freedom of speech, expression, association, and conscience (¶¶223, 239 J. Chandrachud). The minority found the right to form a civil union is essential for the full enjoyment of intimate associations (¶¶218, 223 J. Chandrachud). Justice Chandrachud’s opinion outlined some of the benefits that would accrue to civil unions, such as police protection from interference with their marriage (¶¶282-286 J. Chandrachud), and as discussed below, the right to adopt.No right for unmarried or non-hetrosexual couples to adoptA majority of three judges (Justices Bhat, Kohli, and Narasimha) held that Section 57(2) of JJ Act does not permit adoption by unmarried couples (¶¶121-122 J. Bhat). Justice Bhat held that Section 57 seeks to protect the best interest of the child, and applying the law to unmarried couples would fail to protect an adopted child if the marriage subsequently breaks down (¶¶123, 126 J. Bhat). Thus, the majority held that unmarried couples (including non-hetrosexual couples) cannot adopt.Chief Justice Chandrachud (in the minority) observed that Section 57 uses the term “couple” (not ‘married couple’) and “spouse” and held that the JJ Act does not stop unmarried couples (including queer couples) from adopting a child (¶299 J. Chandrachud). Chief Justice Chandrachud further held that Regulation 5(3) of the CARA Adoption Regulations, which restricts adoption to single individuals and married couples who are in stable marital relationship for two years, was inconsistent with the JJ Act as it restricted adoption to married couples despite the JJ Act not doing so (¶300 J. Chandrachud). Regulation 5(3) of the CARA Adoption Regulations is ultra vires the JJ Act and is read down to exclude the word “marital”. Hence, the reference to a ‘couple’ in Regulation 5 includes both married and unmarried couples as well as queer couples (¶340(p) J. Chandrachud).Transgender persons in hetrosexual relations can marryThe Supreme Court held that a transgender person in a heterosexual relationship is entitled to marry (¶277 J. Chandrachud, ¶119 J. Bhat). The Court reasoned that marriage laws in India permit marriages arising out of heterosexual relationships (¶276 J. Chandrachud). The existing laws such as the SMA, 1954 or other personal laws describe a marital relationship between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’, ‘husband’ and a ‘wife’, ‘bride and a bridegroom’(¶278 J. Chandrachud). If this was interpreted to exclude transgender persons, it would violate Article 15 of the Constitution and the Transgender Persons Act, 2019 which prohibits discrimination against transgender persons (¶277 J. Chandrachud). Further, the Court stated that a person is a transgender person by virtue of their gender identity and not their sexual orientation (¶277 J. Chandrachud).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

8,03-10-2023,PANKAJ BANSAL vs UNION OF INDIACrl.A. No. 3051-3052/2023,"Requirements of a legal arrest under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.","PANKAJ BANSAL V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 866 (3 October 2023)Justices:  Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice Sanjay KumarQuestion(s):  Whether the arrest of the Appellants was valid and in conformity with the requirements of Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”).Factual Background:  On 12 May 2023, the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”) issued summons to the Appellant’s company, the M3M Group, calling on them to provide information and documents pertaining to certain transactions. On 1 June 2023, the ED raided the property of M3M Group and seized their assets and bank accounts and arrested a Mr. Roop Bansal, who was a promoter in the M3M.The Appellants (Pankaj Bansal and his father Mr. Basant Bansal), apprehending arrest by the ED, approached the Delhi High Court for anticipatory bail. On 9 June 2023, the Delhi High Court granted them anticipatory bail till the next hearing on 5 July 2023 since the ED had not implicated them in its investigation. The High Court also found that the Appellants had not even been summoned by the ED in the case.The ED then filed another Information Report on 13 June 2023 against Mr. Sudhir Parmar and Mr. Roop Bansal. Summons were also issued to the Appellants on the same day. Both Mr. Pankaj Bansal and Mr. Basant Bansal were present at the ED’s office in New Delhi on 14 June 2023. However, the ED claimed that they had evaded a summons in connection with a second Information Report and so, both of them were arrested under Section 19(1) of the PMLA. The Additional Sessions Judge, Panchkula, remanded the Appellants to the ED’s custody for five days of interrogation.The arrest and remand were challenged by the Appellants before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions and the Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of India.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (Two Judges) of the Supreme Court only considered whether the arrest of the Appellants under Section 19 of the PMLA was lawful. The Court examined the manner in which the Appellants were arrested by the ED and held that the safeguards under Section 19 of the PMLA were violated. The Additional Session Judge’s order remanding the Appellants into ED custody did not record a finding that the Sessions Judge had examined the grounds of arrest or that they were satisfied that the requirements of Section 19 of the PMLA had been satisfied. The Supreme Court ruled under Section 19(1) of the PMLA, the arrested person must be provided with a written copy of the grounds of their arrest.The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and ordered that the Appellants be released from custody immediately and their arrest be set aside. The judgement of the Court was authored by Justice Sanjay Kumar.Reasons for the Decision:  Safeguards under Section 19 of PMLASection 19 of the PMLA prescribes how the arrest of a person allegedly involved in money laundering can be effected (¶14). Relying on Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v. Union of India (2022 INSC 757), the Supreme Court observed that Section 19 had certain inbuilt safeguards that had to be adhered to by the high-ranking officials authorising arrest. These included recording reasons for the official’s belief that the person was involved in the offence of money laundering and informing the accused of the grounds for their arrest (¶14). This requirement flows from Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India (¶14).The Supreme Court also noted that Section 19 of the PMLA required the authorised officer to forward the copy of the arrest order along with all the material in his possession concerning the necessity to arrest the person to the Adjudicating Authority (¶14). The authorised officer is also required to produce the arrested person before the Special Court or Judicial Magistrate within 24 hours in compliance with Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (¶14). Finally, following the case of V. Senthil Balaji v. State (2023 INSC 677), the Adjudicating Authority under the PMLA must satisfy themselves that there has been due compliance with the safeguards under Section 19 of the PMLA (¶15). Otherwise, the arrest and any remand for interrogation will be unlawful and violative of Article 22(1) of the Constitution (¶15-16).In the present case, the Supreme Court found that the Additional Sessions Judge had failed to ascertain whether the ED had recorded the reasons to believe that the Appellants were guilty of an offence under the PMLA (¶18). Moreover, the Sessions Judge had failed to record his own satisfaction regarding whether the requirements under Section 19 of the PMLA had been complied with by the ED (¶18).Informing arrested person about grounds of arrestGiven that Section 19 of the PMLA did not specify exactly how the ED was to ‘inform’ the arrested person of the grounds of their arrest, the Supreme Court examined how individuals should be ‘informed’ (¶26). The Court held that the statutory language used in Section 19(1) of the PMLA and the constitutional mandate under Article 22(1) of the Constitution of India (which requires that an arrested person be informed of the ground of their arrest as soon as possible) require that the arrested person to be provided with a written copy of the grounds of their arrest (¶35). The Court observed that conveying this information to an arrested person is necessary to enable them to seek legal counsel and present their case for bail before a court (¶33). However, the Court also held that sensitive information which may compromise the investigation could be redacted when providing the arrested person with the grounds for their arrest (¶34).In the present case, the Supreme Court found that the grounds of arrest was not communicated in the proper manner to the Appellants and thus, their arrest was violative of Section 19(1) of the PMLA (¶35).Analysis by Supreme Court on the conduct of investigation by the EDThe Supreme Court found that the manner in which the ED conducted the investigation of the case was not transparent or fair and lacked good faith (¶20). The Court noted that the ED had filed a second Information Report on 13-14 June 2023, declined to disclose the pending Information Report to the Delhi High Court, and summoned and arrested the Appellants as soon as they received anticipatory bail from the Delhi High Court (¶19-22).The ED had argued that the arrest of the Appellants was because they had failed to cooperate with the ED in their investigation and had failed to respond to the summons (¶25). The Supreme Court held that mere non-cooperation of a witness cannot render him liable to be arrested under Section 19 of PMLA (¶25).Noting that the clandestine and bad faith conduct of the ED during the investigation demonstrated an arbitrary exercise of power, the Court ordered that the judicial custody of the Appellants was not warranted and that their arrest be set aside and they be released (¶35-36).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

9,11-09-2023,C.B.I. vs DR. R.R. KISHORECrl.A. No. 377/2007,"Whether the Supreme Court's invalidation of Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 would have retrospective effect.","C.B.I. V. DR. R.R. KISHORE2023 INSC 817 (11 September 2023)Justices:  Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Jitendra K. MaheshwariQuestion(s):  Whether the Supreme Court’s 2014 invalidation of Section 6-A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (“DSPE Act”), which stated that corruption investigations into senior government officials can only begin with the Union Government’s approval, would have a retrospective effect, or would apply from the date the Supreme Court struck down the provision.Factual Background:  Dr. R.R. Kishore was the Chief District Medical Officer in the Government of Delhi. In 2004, he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) while allegedly accepting a bribe for “setting things right” for a radiologist conducting an illegal sex-determination test.Dr. Kishore challenged the arrest before the Delhi High Court claiming that the CBI did not obtain the mandatory approval under Section 6A(1) of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (“DSPE Act”) to arrest him. Section 6A of the DSPE Act requires that the Union Government grant prior approval before an investigation under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (“PC Act”) against a State official at a Joint Secretary level designation or higher. A Chief District Medical Officer is a Joint Secretary level rank officer.In October, 2006, the Delhi High Court held that Dr. Kishore’s arrest was illegal as approval under S. 6A(1) of DSPE Act was not taken before arrest. In January, 2007, the CBI filed an appeal against the High Court’s decision at the Supreme Court.On 6 May 2014, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Dr. Subramanian Swamy v Director, Central Bureau of Investigation (2014 INSC 358) (“Subramanian Swamy”) declared Section 6A(1) of the DSPE Act unconstitutional because it violated the Right to Equality under Article 14. The Court held that immunity cannot be restricted to a certain rank of officers only above the Joint Secretary level.After the Subramanian Swamy judgment, the CBI contended that since the provision has been declared unconstitutional, it never had any legal effect and Dr. R.R. Kishore cannot claim that the CBI breached the provision during its investigation. Dr. R.R. Kishore contended that even though the Supreme Court declared the law to be invalid, the Court did not say that the law never had any effect (i.e., the Court’s invalidation was not retrospective). Because Dr. R.R. Kishore’s investigation took place prior to the Court’s invalidation of Section 6A, Dr. R.R. Kishore argued when his investigation took place, Section 6A had legal effect and the CBI’s investigation violated Section 6A. According to Dr. R.R. Kishore, giving retrospective effect to the judgment would violate the constitutional protection in Article 20(1) that no person shall be punished under a law that was not in force at the time the offence was committed. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the declaration in Subramanian Swamy will have retrospective effect, and Section 6A of DSPE Act will not have legal effect from its date of insertion, i.e. 11 September 2003. The Court ruled that once a law is declared unconstitutional then it would be void ab initio (i.e., treated as not having any legal effect from the day it was enacted). As a result, Section 6A will offer no protection to senior civil servants even if their investigation began prior to the Supreme Court’s judgment in 2014. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Vikram Nath.Reasons for the Decision:  Applicability of Article 20 of the ConstitutionThe Supreme Court referred to Article 20(1) of the Constitution which states that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violating a law that is in force at the time of the commission of the offence. The Article also provides that a person cannot be subjected to a punishment greater than that which is given under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence (¶25). The Court held that what is prohibited under Article 20 is conviction of a new offence or imposing an enhanced sentence under a law which was not in force when the act was committed (¶27). However, the changes to investigation and trial procedure itself after the commission of the offence are not prohibited (¶27). An investigation or trial under a procedure different from the one at the time of commission of the offence does not violate Article 20(1) of the Constitution (¶27).The Supreme Court noted that the invalidation of Section 6A of the DSPE Act does not introduce any new offence or conviction. It is a procedural provision regarding investigations under the PC Act (¶23). The Court noted that modifications to procedural provisions cannot be considered to create a new offence (¶33(xi)). The Court noted that the issue involved in the present reference relates to a matter of procedure, and not the two aspects of conviction or enhanced sentence that are covered by sub-article (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution (¶31).Retrospective application of judgment in the case of Subramanian SwamyThe Supreme Court stated that according to Article 13(2) of the Constitution, a law which violates the fundamental rights set out in the Constitution is invalid (¶41). The Court then observed that in Subramanian Swamy, the Constitution Bench had found that Section 6A of the DSPE Act violates Article 14 which guarantees the right to equality. Hence, Section 6A would be invalid according to Article 13(2) of the Constitution (¶41).The Supreme Court found that any law held to be unconstitutional for whatever reason, whether due to lack of legislative competence or in violation of fundamental rights, would be void ab initio (i.e., treated as not having any legal effect from the day it was enacted) (¶42(vii)). The Court also noted that an unconstitutional law is not a valid law and cannot confer any rights or offer any protections, it is inoperative as though it had never been passed (¶42(vii)). Thus, the declaration made by the Constitution Bench in the case of Subramanian Swamy will have retrospective operation (¶43).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

10,04-09-2023,AMEENA BEGUM vs THE STATE OF TELANGANACrl.A. No. 2706/2023,Guidelines to review preventive detention orders.,"AMEENA BEGUM V. THE STATE OF TELANGANA2023 INSC 788 (4 September 2023)Justices:  Justice Surya Kant, Justice Dipankar DattaQuestion(s):  Whether the preventive detention order passed against the Appellant’s husband is valid.Factual Background:  The Commissioner of Police in Hyderabad issued a detention order against the Appellant's husband (“detenu”) under the provisions of Section 3(2) of the Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act, 1986 (“the Telangana Act”). The detenu was alleged to have habitually committed serious offences including outraging the modesty of women, cheating, extortion, obstructing the public servants from discharging their legitimate duties, robbery and criminal intimidation along with his associates in an organised manner.The Appellant’s wife challenged the detention order. However, after review, the Advisory Board under the Telangana Act deemed the detention justified. Consequently, the State Government confirmed the detention order, directing its continuation for a year from the date of detention (27 January 2023). Subsequently, the Appellant’s wife filed a petition in the Telangana High Court, which was rejected. Thereafter, an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court quashed the detention order and directed for the release of the detenu. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Datta.The Supreme Court also laid down the following guidelines for courts to follow when reviewing preventive detention orders:The authority must consider all relevant circumstances and not rely on extraneous material.The power of preventive detention must be exercised for the intended purpose and not for unauthorised reasons.The detaining authority must act independently and not under external influence.The authority should not disable itself from considering individual cases.The satisfaction must be based on material that demonstrably satisfies statutory mandates.There should be a clear link between past conduct and the need for detention, without relying on stale material.The grounds for detention must be relevant and be shared with the detenu, allowing for representation.The detention process must adhere strictly to the timelines provided by the relevant law.Reasons for the Decision:  Detention order is unsustainable and indefensibleThe Supreme Court observed that the detention order was based on five distinct offences, including outraging modesty of women, cheating, obstructing public officials, and dacoity (¶3, ¶28). The Court found that the offences in the detention order were isolated acts affecting private individuals and did not disrupt public life (¶39). Additionally, it noted that past criminal history alone cannot justify detention and cautioned against the inclusion of extraneous factors in detention orders (¶46). The Court also highlighted the importance of clear and comprehensible language in detention orders (¶49). The Court held that preventive detention laws, reserved for emergency or fast-moving situations, should not have been invoked in this case for the enforcement of ordinary 'law and order' issues (¶40).Distinction between ‘law and order’ and ‘public order’The Supreme Court noted that Section 3 of the Telangana Act required the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority before a detention order can be issued (¶26). The Court focused on two main issues: whether the alleged acts prejudiced 'public order' and whether all relevant circumstances were considered (¶29). Referring to Section 2(a) of the Act, the Court explained ‘public order’ as situations causing harm, danger, alarm, or insecurity among the public or posing a grave danger to life or public health (¶35). Incidents categorised under ‘law and order’ pertain to breaches of specific laws affecting individual rights or small groups without causing widespread societal disruption (¶38). It distinguished between 'law and order' and 'public order', and held that not every breach of law leads to public disorder (¶¶30-31).Purpose of preventive detention and limited judicial reviewThe Supreme Court observed that preventive detention involves loss of liberty without trial and is aimed at safeguarding the security and welfare of the state (¶9, ¶24). It is a precautionary measure to prevent potential harm to society, based on suspicion or anticipation rather than proof (¶10). Limited judicial review is available for aggrieved detainees (¶10).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

11,01-09-2023,REVANASIDDAPPA vs MALLIKARJUNC.A. No. 2844/2011,Right of child born out of void or voidable marriage to inherit coparcenary (joint family) property.,"REVANASIDDAPPA V. MALLIKARJUN2023 INSC 783 (1 September 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Whether a child born out of a void marriage or a voidable marriage is entitled to coparcenary property (i.e., ancestral or joint-family property) of the parents or only the self-acquired property of the parents.Factual Background:  In 2003, a Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court in Jinia Keotin v. Kumar Sitaram Manjhi (2002 INSC 576) (“Jinia Keotin”) held that a child born from a void marriage (a marriage that does not have any legal effect) or a voidable marriage (a marriage that may be annulled by one spouse) would have no right to claim inheritance in ancestral or coparcenary property (joint-family property). This judgment was later followed in Neelamma v. Sarojamma [(2006) 9 SCC 612] (“Neelamma”) and Bharatha Matha v. R Vijaya Renganathan (2010 INSC 328) (“Bharatha Matha”).The present appeal at the Supreme Court (Revanasiddappa v. Mallikarjun) was filed against the judgment of the Karnataka High Court by illegitimate sons of one Shri Shivasharanappa. The sons claimed a share in ancestral properties. The wife of Shivasharanappa, along with her two sons, stated that Shivasharanappa had married a second woman while still married to her and therefore, the children born out of this second marriage are not entitled to any share in Shivasharanappa’s ancestral property.At the Supreme Court, a Division Bench (two judges) in Revanasiddappa v. Mallikarjun (2011 INSC 251) doubted the correctness of the decisions in Jinia Keotin, Neelamma, and Bharatha Matha and referred the case to a larger bench of three-judges.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that children born out of void or voidable marriages are entitled to a share in their parents' ancestral properties. The Court clarified that such children are not coparceners in the ancestral property (a person who shares equally with others in the inheritance of an undivided property) and cannot claim an equal share in the ancestral property in their own right. However, children from void and voidable marriages are entitled to a right in their parents’ share of the ancestral property. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Legitimacy of children born out of void or voidable marriagesThe Supreme Court found that Section 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (“HMA”) provides that children born out of void and voidable marriages though “illegitimate”, shall be treated as legitimate (¶12). The Court noted that the law has a socially beneficial purpose of removing the stigma of illegitimacy faced by children of such marriages, since the children themselves are innocent (¶3).Right in Property of ParentsThe Supreme Court noted that an illegitimate who is deemed to be legitimate under Section 16(3) of the HMA will only have inheritance rights in the property of their parents and not have any rights in the property of a person other than their parents (¶42).The Court noted children born out of valid marriage are coparceners in the Hindu joint-family property and they have a share in the ancestral property apart from and equal to their parents. On the death of their parents, they are then equally entitled to a share of their parents property. On the other hand, children born out of void and voidable marriage are not coparceners in the Hindu-Joint family property, they are only entitled to a share in their parents’ property (¶43).The Court noted that to ascertain the property of parents, Section 6(3) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 provides that for a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener, their share in the property would be the part that would have been allotted to him if a partition had taken place immediately before his death (¶40). Thus, the Court concluded that the children born out of void and voidable marriage are entitled to: (i) a share in the ancestral property that would be allotted to their parents on partition, and (ii) a share in the self-acquired property of the parents (¶50).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

12,07-08-2023,V. SENTHIL BALAJI vs THE STATE REPRESENTED BY DEPUTY DIRECTORCrl.A. No. 2284-2285/2023,Habeas corpus petition filed by Cabinet Minister of Tamil Nadu.,"V. SENTHIL BALAJI V. THE STATE REPRESENTED BY DEPUTY DIRECTOR2023 INSC 677 (7 August 2023)Justices:  Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice M. M. SundreshQuestion(s):  (i) Is the habeas corpus petition filed for the release of the Appellant from arrest under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”) maintainable? (ii) Can the time spent by the Appellant in hospital be excluded from the custody period? Factual Background:  On 14 June 2023, the Appellant, a Cabinet Minister of the State of Tamil Nadu, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) under Section 19 of the PMLA. Section 19 empowers authorised officers of the ED to arrest persons believed to have committed an offence of money laundering. On the same day, the Appellant was taken to hospital when he complained of chest pain. His wife filed a habeas corpus petition before the Madras High Court to secure his release. Meanwhile, the State filed an application seeking judicial custody of the Appellant for fifteen days before the Trial Court.On 14 June 2023, the Trial Court found that there existed a prima facie case against the Appellant. It sent the Appellant to judicial custody for fifteen days, until 28 June 2023. On 15 June 2023, the High Court directed that the Appellant be moved to a private hospital of his choice to undergo a bypass surgery. After the surgery, on 16 June 2023, the Trial Court granted custody of the Appellant to the State for eight days, permitting interrogation on the condition that he be allowed to remain in the hospital where he was receiving treatment.The State filed an application before the High Court seeking to exclude the period of hospitalisation while calculating the period of custody since no physical custody of the Appellant had been takenA split verdict by a Division Bench (two judges) of the High Court led the matter to be referred to a third Judge of the High Court. While dismissing the Appellant’s habeas corpus petition, the third Judge asked the Division Bench to decide the date from which the period of custody was to be calculated. Both the Appellant and the State petitioned the Supreme Court. The State sought to exclude the time spent by the Appellant in hospital from the total custody period. The Appellant argued that under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) a Magistrate can authorize the detention of the accused for a maximum period of fifteen days for investigation, and such detention can only be by police officers and not members of other investigative agencies such as the ED. Since fifteen days had passed, the Appellant was entitled to be released.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court dismissed the Appellant’s habeas corpus petition. It interpreted custody to mean actual physical custody and excluded the time spent by the Appellant in hospital from the custody period. It granted the State custody of the Appellant until 12 August 2023. The Court observed that the larger issue of whether the fifteen day period of custody in favour of the police referred to in Section 167(2) CrPC can only be within the first fifteen days of remand or span the entire period of investigation as a whole, should be placed before a larger Bench for its consideration. The decision of the Court was authored by Justice Sundresh.Reasons for the Decision:  Habeas corpus is a remedy for illegal detentionThe Supreme Court observed that a writ of habeas corpus could only be issued when detention was illegal (¶29). Thus, the writ would only lie in connection to a Section 19 PMLA arrest, if a person was not produced before a court within twenty-four hours of arrest as mandated in Section 19(3). The Court found that the arrest of the Appellant was procedurally compliant, and the Trial Court had passed a reasoned order of remand under Section 167(2) of the CrPC on the day of arrest itself, 14 June 2023 (¶¶30, 81). In this context, the only remedy available to the Appellant was to challenge the order of remand before a higher forum, rather than invoking the constitutional writ jurisdiction of the High Court by filing a habeas corpus petition (¶30).PMLA is a special codeThe Appellant argued that the State had violated its duty under Section 41A of the CrPC. Section 41A provides for the issue of a notice to a person prior to arrest (¶21). The Supreme Court found that the PMLA was a one of a kind code, with its own mechanisms concerning searches, seizures and arrests, and its own safeguards (¶32). In light of Section 65 of the PMLA, which provides that its provisions will override those of the CrPC, officers of the ED were not required to follow Section 41A of the CrPC (¶¶32, 35, 45).Custody means actual custodyThe Supreme Court found that custody did not mean legal custody but actual or physical custody (¶¶57, 60). It observed that once an order was passed granting custody, any external interference in the securing of this custody including a court order, would not start the period of custody (¶60). As a result, the fifteen days of custody could not be reduced by the hospitalisation of the Appellant, which was effected through a court order (¶60). To reach this conclusion, the Court relied on the doctrine of actus curiae neminem gravabit, which states that no person (the ED in this case) can be prejudiced by an act of court (¶60).Custody not limited to police custodyThe Supreme Court found that the expression “such custody” in Section 167(2) of the CrPC included not only police custody but also the custody of other investigating agencies such as the ED (¶¶54, 88). It noted that Section 167(2) consciously omits the expression “police custody” and gives the Magistrate the discretion to determine the kind of custody whether judicial, police or that of an investigating agency or other entity to be granted (¶54).Fifteen day custody period not restricted to fifteen days within order of remandThe Appellant had cited CBI v. Anupam J. Kulkarni (1992 INSC 154) (“Anupam J. Kulkarni”) to argue that the maximum period of fifteen days of custody referred to in Section 167(2) of the CrPC meant the first fifteen days from the order of remand (¶22). The Supreme Court found that the maximum period of fifteen days applied across the entire period of investigation since nothing in Section 167(2) suggested it had to be the first fifteen days (¶¶63, 73). But in its concluding paragraph, the Court directed that the issue considered in Anupam J. Kulkarni, of whether the maximum period should be only the first fifteen days, be decided by a larger Bench of the Supreme Court (¶91).Prepared by Avanti DivanCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

13,11-07-2023,DR. JAYA THAKUR vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 456/2022,Challenge to the extension of tenures granted to the Directors of the Enforcement Directorate and the Central Bureau of Investigation.,"DR. JAYA THAKUR V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 616 (11 July 2023)Justices:  Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Vikram Nath, and Justice Sanjay KarolQuestion(s):  (i) Do the amendments to the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 and the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 allowing three one-year extensions to the Directors of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate threaten the independence of these investigative agencies, and could they allow for extension of Mr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra’s tenure in violation of a specific Supreme Court order? (ii) Are the Amendments contrary to the Supreme Court’s decision in Common Cause v. Union of India (2021 INSC 459) (“Common Cause”)?Factual Background:  On 13 November 2020, the tenure of Mr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra, the Director of the ED was extended beyond two years. However, in September 2021, the Supreme Court, in the Common Cause decision, held that such extensions should only be granted in rare and exceptional cases and for a brief period. The Court specifically ruled against any further extension of Mr. Mishra’s tenure beyond the first extension.On 14 December 2021, Parliament enacted the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Act, 2021, and the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Act, 2021, amending the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (“DSPE Act”) and the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 (“Vigilance Act”), respectively. These Amendments allowed the Union Government to extend the tenure of Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) and the Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) directors with up to three one-year extensions. Prior to the amendment, the tenure of the directors could be up to two years.These provisions allowing for the extension of tenure were initially introduced through Ordinances on 15 November 2021. Despite the Supreme Court's directive, Mr. Sanjay Kumar Mishra’s tenure saw a second extension for a year on 17 November 2021, followed by a third extension on 17 November 2022.These Amendments and tenure extension orders were challenged on the grounds that they violated principles of fair investigation and fair trial, and afforded the Union Government substantial control over the Director’s tenure, compromising the independence of the CBI and ED and violating the Supreme Court’s previous directions. The Union of India contended that these agencies continue to be independent as extensions are granted on the recommendation of a High Level Committee consisting of the Central Vigilance Commissioner and the Vigilance Commissioners, who are totally independent and impartial persons. The continuity of Mr. Mishra’s leadership was argued to be crucial.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the Amendments to the DPSE and Vigilance Act. However, the Court ruled that the second and third extensions of Mr. Mishra’s tenure on 17 November 2021 and 17 November 2022 were illegal and in violation of the Supreme Court’s Common Cause decision. The Court directed the Union Government to appoint a new Director for the Enforcement Directorate by 31 July 2023, while Mr. Mishra continues in the role until then. The Three-Judge Bench judgment was authored by Justice B.R. Gavai. Reasons for the Decision:  The Amendments are constitutionalThe Supreme Court noted that a statute enacted by Parliament or a State Legislature could only be struck down on two grounds: firstly, that the Legislature does not have competence to make a law and secondly, the law violates fundamental rights or other constitutional provisions (¶¶70-71).The Supreme Court examined the process of appointing the directors. The Director of the ED is recommended by a Committee led by the Central Vigilance Commissioner, with members including secretaries from the Ministries of Home Affairs, Personnel, and Revenue (¶78). The Central Vigilance Commissioner, who leads this Committee, is appointed by a three-member body comprising the Prime Minister, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament (¶80). Similarly, the Director of the CBI is recommended by a Committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, and the Chief Justice of India (or a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated by the CJI) (¶86).The Supreme Court held that in both instances, the safeguards in the statute insulated these officers from external pressures, allowing them to act independently (¶85). Under the new amendment, the Committees are empowered to recommend extensions for incumbent directors in the public interest, provided they give written reasons for the extension (¶90). The Court asserted that if the Committee can be trusted with the initial appointment, there is no reason why the same Committee cannot be trusted with extensions (¶93). These extensions are not being granted arbitrarily at the ‘sweet-will’ of the Government (¶91).Second and Third extension of Mr. Mishra’s tenure is invalidThe Supreme Court held that a direction issued by the Court cannot be subsequently nullified by an enactment, as doing so amounts to intrusion into judicial power and violates rule of law (¶114). In the decision of Common Cause, after upholding the first tenure extension granted to Mr. Mishra, the Court specifically issued a direction that no further extension shall be granted to Mr. Mishra (¶111). Both the Union of India and Mr. Mishra were parties to the proceedings and were bound by Court’s direction (¶103). Hence the subsequent extensions given to Mr. Mishra were illegal (¶121(ii)).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

14,18-05-2023,THE ANIMAL WELFARE BOARD OF INDIA  vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 23/2016,Challenge to Tamil Nadu's amendments to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and its permitting of 'Jallikattu'.,"THE ANIMAL WELFARE BOARD OF INDIA  V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 548 (18 May 2023)Justices:  Justice Kurian. M. Joseph, Justice Ajay Rastogi, Justice Aniruddha Bose, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Chudalayil T. Ravikumar, Question(s):  (i) Whether Tamil Nadu’s amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act permitting Jallikattu in the state of Tamil Nadu is contrary to the Supreme Court’s ban on the sport. (ii) Whether Jallikattu is part of the cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu. (iii) Whether the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 violates the right to equality and life of animals.Factual Background:  In May 2014, the Supreme Court in Animal Welfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja (2014 INSC 370) (“A. Nagaraja”) banned Jallikattu and bullock-cart racing. It held that the practices caused unnecessary pain and suffering to animals, as per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 (“PCA Act”).In January 2017, the Tamil Nadu government passed the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 which permitted the sport of Jallikattu and introduced rules to govern its practice. The Maharashtra Legislature enacted similar amendments to the PCA Act to allow bullock-cart races and and the State of Karnataka issued rules laying down rigid regulatory measures for conducting Kambala which is a bullock-cart race in the state.A group of animal rights activists and organisations challenged the Amendments at the Supreme Court as being violative of the Supreme Court Judgment in A. Nagaraja. The petitions also contended that only the Union government has the power to frame rules under PCA Act and hence the rules framed by the Tamil Nadu Legislature are invalid and therefore inapplicable.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 permitting Jallikattu is not contrary to the Supreme Court’s judgment in A. Nagaraja. The Court held that the issues with Jallikattu pointed out in A. Nagaraja has been overcome by the State Amendment Acts by minimising the pain and suffering to the animals during the conduct of the sport. The Court further held that Jallikattu is part of the cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu and that the fundamental rights to equality and life cannot be extended to animals. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Aniruddha Bose.Reasons for the Decision:  The Amendments minimised crueltyThe Supreme Court found that the sport of Jallikattu, Kambala and Bullock Cart Racing permitted by the Amendment Acts of the three States minimised the pain and suffering that would be caused to the bulls (¶30). The Court noted that the Rules enacted by the States specify isolated arenas for the sports to be conducted including the setting up of both bull run and bull collection areas, and galleries separating spectators from directly coming into contact with bulls (¶28). The Court noted that A. Nagaraja banned Jallikattu because of the cruel manner in which the animals were treated during the sport but after the amendments by the State most of the harmful practices have been substantially minimised. Thus, the Amendments are not contrary to the A. Nagaraja judgment (¶30).Jallikattu is a cultural practiceThe Supreme Court noted that Jallikattu has been going on in the State of Tamil Nadu for at least the last few centuries but whether this has become an integral part of Tamil culture or not requires religious, cultural and social analysis, which is an exercise that cannot be undertaken by the judiciary (¶40(ii)). The Court also noted that the State has determined Jallikattu to be a part of cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu and the Court decided not to interfere with this view of the legislature (¶40(ii)). The Court clarified that the view reflected in A. Nagaraja that the performance of Jallikattu is not a part of the cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu does not hold good (¶40(ii)).Fundamental Rights not to be extended to animalsThe Supreme Court stated that there is no precedent which states that animals have fundamental rights (¶24). The Court recalled that the A. Nagaraja judgment also does not lay down that animals have Fundamental Rights. According to the Court, a legislation can be challenged on the basis of reasonableness as per Article 14 of the Constitution of India. However, Article 14 and Article 21 cannot be invoked by an animal (¶24).State government had the authority to pass the amendmentsThe Supreme Court held that the primary focus of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 relates to Entry 17 of List III (Prevention of cruelty to animals) of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Under the Constitutional scheme of the Seventh Schedule, both the Union and the States have a right to make laws concerning issues under List III (¶40(iii)). Before passing the amendment to the PCA Act, Tamil Nadu obtained Presidential assent under Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India which provides that if a State Government makes a law on a topic that both the States and the Union Government can make laws about (List III), and the state law clashes with a previous law made by the Union Government, the state law can still be enforced if the President approves it (¶9).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

15,11-05-2023,GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI vs UNION OF INDIAC.A. No. 2357/2017,Whether the Government of Delhi or the Lt. Governor of Delhi has control over the civil services of Delhi.,"GOVT. OF NCT OF DELHI V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 517 (11 May 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Mukeshkumar R. Shah, Justice Krishna Murari, Justice Hima Kohli, Justice Pamidighantam S. NarasimhaQuestion(s):  Whether the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (“GNCTD”) or the Union Government (acting through the Lt. Governor of Delhi) has control over civil “services” in Delhi according to Entry 41 of the State List of Schedule VII of the Constitution.Factual Background:  On 21 May 2015, the Union Government issued a Presidential notification (“2015 Notification”) which said that the Lt. Governor of Delhi shall exercise control over the “services” (i.e., civil services) in Delhi. Schedule VII of the Constitution lists “services” under Entry 41 of the State List and thus, State Governments typically control the civil services in the State. However, the 2015 notification removed “services” from the control of the GNCTD and placed the civil services under the control of the Lt. Governor of Delhi. The GNCTD challenged the 2015 Notification before the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the GNCTD had legislative and executive power over the “services” under Entry 41 of List II of the Schedule VII of the Constitution. Thus, in cases regarding civil services and the power to supervise or exercise control over the transfer or suspension of civil servants, the Lt. Governor of NCT of Delhi would be bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the GNCTD. However, because Article 239AA confers the Union Government with exclusive legislative power over public order, police, and land in Delhi, the Court held that the Union Government shall exercise power over civil services relating to these specific areas of governance. The decision of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Legislative and executive powers of Delhi Government under the ConstitutionThe Supreme Court referred to its 2018 Constitution Bench (five judges) decision in Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India to hold that the NCT of Delhi had a unique nature by virtue of Article 239AA of the Constitution, and this set it apart from other Union Territories (¶12). As executive power is co-extensive with legislative power, the executive power of the NCTD extended to all matters with respect to which the GNCTD had the power to legislate (¶19). Article 239AA states that the Legislative Assembly of Delhi shall have power to make laws for Delhi with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List “in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union territories” except matters with respect to certain excluded entries of public order, police and land in the State List.The Union of India had contended that the phrase “in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories” in Article 239AA(3)(a) meant that the GNCTD had power to legislate on any entry only if such an entry was clearly applicable to all Union Territories as a class (¶10). However, the Supreme Court dismissed this contention and held that the phrase in Article 239AA was an inclusive term and interpreted it to mean that the Legislative Assembly of Delhi has the power to legislate on any subject in the State or Concurrent Lists, except the expressly excluded subjects of public order, police and land under Article 239AA(3)(a) (¶¶23-25).Delhi’s special statusThe Supreme Court reasoned that if the phrase “in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories” was interpreted to exclude many more entries than what was expressly excluded by Article 239AA(3), then it would defeat the very purpose of granting a “special status” to Delhi over other Union Territories (¶46). This “special status” for Delhi (granted by the Sixty-Ninth Constitutional Amendment) introduced a legislative assembly in Delhi to provide for local governance and democratic popular representation (¶36). Reducing the legislative powers of the Delhi legislature would distort the balance between local interests of the people of Delhi and national interests of the Union for good governance of the national capital (¶46).Role of civil servantsThe Supreme Court also discussed the principles underlying the role of civil servants in a modern parliamentary democracy like India (¶97). It referred to the triple chain of accountability which led to a responsible democratic government wherein civil servants were responsible to the elected ministers; ministers were accountable to the legislature; and the legislature was finally accountable to the electorate (¶106). Civil servants formed the foundation of a responsible government since they implemented and administered the government decisions and policy which, by extension, was the will of the electorate. So, in case civil servants and “civil services” were not under the control of elected representatives, it could lead to unaccountable and non-responsive civil servants that would disregard the will of the elected minister and indirectly the electorate (¶107).Additional observationsThe Union of India had submitted that the GNCTD does not have legislative competence over Entry 41 of List II because Part XIV of the Constitution (which covers Services under the Union and the States) does not contemplate any services for Union Territories (¶122). However, the Supreme Court referred to the inclusive definition of “State” in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, where the term “State” included even Union Territories. Thus, Part XIV was applicable to Union Territories like Delhi (¶132).The Supreme Court also held that the exercise of rule-making power by the Union Government (through the President of India) under Article 309 of the Constitution (regarding recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving in the civil services of the Union or a State) would not oust the legislative power of the Government of NCTD to make laws over Entry 41 of the State List in Schedule VII (¶144).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

Subsequently, the SSLP split into two factions – one led by Mr. Thackeray and another by Mr. Shinde – and each side claimed to be the ‘real’ SSLP. Mr. Shinde’s faction violated a whip issued by Mr. Thackeray’s Chief Whip calling for a meeting of all Shiv Sena members of the legislative assembly (“MLAs”). The faction led by Mr. Thackeray then issued a resolution removing Mr. Shinde as Group Leader of the SSLP and filed disqualification proceedings against Mr. Shinde and his MLAs on the ground of defection under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. At this stage, the office of the Speaker in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly was vacant. The Deputy Speaker took up the disqualification proceedings and issued notice to Mr. Shinde and his faction. Mr. Shinde’s faction, in turn, issued a notice for removing the Deputy Speaker on the grounds that the Deputy Speaker no longer enjoyed the support of the majority in the State Legislature. In Nabam Rebia & Bamang Felix v. Deputy Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly (2016 INSC 526) (“Nabam Rebia”) a Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court had held that such a notice prevented the Speaker from deciding disqualification proceedings.In the meanwhile, the Governor of Maharashtra issued notice to Mr. Thackeray requesting him to prove his majority on the floor of the House. Before the floor test could be held, Mr. Thackeray resigned as Chief Minister. Subsequently, Mr. Shinde, with the support of MLAs from the Bharatiya Janata Party, was appointed the new Chief Minister and a new Speaker was elected. The Petitioners filed a Writ Petition before the Supreme Court seeking to quash the appointment of Mr. Shinde as the Chief Minister while the Respondents filed another Writ Petition praying that the Deputy Speaker be prohibited from taking any action under the Tenth Schedule against Mr. Shinde’s faction until the issue of the removal of the Deputy Speaker was decided. These Writ Petitions were combined and heard before the Supreme Court.Mr. Shinde also filed a petition before the Election Commission of India (“Election Commission”) under the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 (“Election Symbols Order”), for allotment of the symbol of the Shiv Sena (i.e. a ‘bow and arrow’) to the faction led by him. The ECI ruled in favour of Mr. Shinde and granted the symbol to Mr. Shinde’s faction.Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Supreme Court held that the Speaker must recognise the whip and leader of the legislature party as appointed by the concerned political party. In the event of a split, the Speaker can decide if MLAs of any faction ought to be disqualified and the Election Commission can decide who can use the party’s symbol. Both these decisions can be taken concurrently and neither the Speaker nor the Election Commission needs to wait for the other’s decision.The Supreme Court held that except in extraordinary cases, neither the High Courts nor the Supreme Court can decide disqualification proceedings under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. The Court further held that an MLA had the right to participate in legislative proceedings while disqualification petitions are pending against them and the validity of decisions taken by the legislature cannot be questioned merely because disqualification petitions were pending against certain members.The Supreme Court ruled that a Governor is only justified in calling a person to prove their majority on the floor of the legislature if the Governor has reasons to believe, based on objective material, that such a person has lost the confidence of the majority of the legislature.On the issue of whether the Speaker can decide disqualification proceedings when a notice for the Speaker’s removal is pending, the correctness of the decision in Nabam Rebia was referred to a larger Bench of seven judges. Until the issue is decided by seven judges, the Court held that the Speaker has the authority to examine whether a motion for their removal was genuine or merely intended to stop them adjudicating disqualification proceedings. If the Speaker found the removal motion to be genuine, then they could pause the disqualification proceedings till the decision on the Speaker’s removal was concluded. Else, the Speaker could reject the motion. The judgment of the Court was unanimous and authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:   Reference of Nabam Rebia to a larger benchThe Supreme Court noted that the correctness of Nabam Rebia was in doubt  because it conflicted with the judgment in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu (1991 INSC 287) (“Kihoto Hollohan”). In Nabam Rabia a Constitution Bench had held that a Speaker ought not to decide disqualification proceedings once proceedings for the Speaker’s own removal had been initiated. In Kihoto Hollohan, another Constitution Bench had held that the independence and impartiality of the Speaker when adjudicating disqualification proceedings cannot be doubted (¶70). Given that both decisions took divergent views on the independence of the Speaker, the Court referred the correctness of Nabam Rebia to a larger bench (¶70). The Court found that the facts in Nabam Rebia were different from the present case and thus, the decision in Nabam Rebia would not apply to the present case (¶67-69).Power of higher courts to decide disqualification petitions in the first instanceThe Petitioners argued that the Speaker cannot be entrusted to adjudicate the disqualification petitions fairly since he was appointed with the support of Mr. Shinde’s MLAs against whom defection proceedings had initially been filed (¶73). The Supreme Court rejected the argument and held that under Paragraph 6 of the Tenth Schedule, the Speaker had the exclusive jurisdiction to decide the disqualification petitions (¶74). Barring any exceptional factual circumstances, the Court should not decide disqualification petitions (¶80). However, the Court could review the final decision of the Speaker (¶85).Validity of proceedings in the legislature during pendency of disqualification petitionsThe Petitioners contended that the validity of decisions taken by the legislature while the disqualification petitions were being decided would depend on the final outcome of the disqualification petitions (¶86). The Supreme Court rejected this contention and clarified that if a member incurs disqualification, then their seat shall become vacant only prospectively from the date of their disqualification and an MLA has the right to participate in the proceedings of the legislature until they are disqualified (¶91). Otherwise, all the decisions of legislatures would become uncertain and unworkable as soon as disqualification petitions were initiated (¶93). Thus, proceedings in the legislature during the pendency of disqualification petitions were valid.Appointment of Whip and Leader of a legislature party The Supreme Court highlighted that there was a difference between the political party and the legislature party under the Tenth Schedule and that the two terms are not one and the same (¶102). In the context of the Tenth Schedule, the legislature party consists only of those members of a political party who had been set up for election by the political party and have been elected to a seat in the legislature (¶105). The Court found that the Speaker must recognise the whip and the leader of the legislature party that was appointed by the political party (¶¶111, 124) since the members of the legislature party are elected due to their affiliation to the political party and owe their allegiance to that political party (¶113). The Court, therefore, held that the resolution removing Mr. Shinde as the Group Leader of the SSLP issued by the Shiv Sena faction led by Mr. Thackeray was valid as it represented the will of the political party under the Shiv Sena party’s constitution (¶122).Deciding who is the ‘real’ Shiv Sena party and allotment of the party symbolThe Petitioners argued that when defection proceedings and a dispute over which faction can use the party’s symbol (before the Election Commission) have arisen simultaneously, then the disqualification proceedings ought to be decided before the Election Commission decides on the party’s symbol since the latter dispute would determine who was the real political party for determining defection (¶¶146-147). The Court, however, stated that the Election Commission can concurrently decide which faction can use the party’s symbol even while disqualification proceedings are ongoing, and both decisions need not be the same as they are based on different considerations (¶154). The Speaker decides disqualification petitions as and when they are initiated, while the decision of the Election Commission would only have prospective effect and will not affect the decision of the Speaker (¶155). Impact of deletion of Paragraph 3 of Tenth ScheduleParagraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule stated that a member of the legislature would not be subject to disqualification if there was a ‘split’ in the original political party where one-third or more members separated to form a different political party from the original political party (¶162). However, Paragraph 3 was deleted by the Constitution (Ninety-First Amendment) Act, 2003. The Supreme Court categorically stated that the defence of ‘split’ was now no longer available to any member(s) who faced disqualification proceedings regardless of whether such member(s) claimed to belong to the original political party or not (¶164). In this case, both factions claimed to be the ‘original’ Shiv Sena political party.Exercise of discretion by Governor ordering the Chief Minister to face floor test and inviting a person to prove his majority in the legislatureThe Supreme Court said that the Governor can only order a floor test requiring a Chief Minister to prove their majority based on some objective material which indicated that the Chief Minister had lost the confidence of the legislature (¶193). In this case, the Court found that there was no such objective material present and that the Governor of Maharashtra called for a floor test based on the request of some MLAs only (¶193). While this was not in accordance with law, the Court recognised that Mr. Thackeray had voluntarily resigned before facing the floor test and the Court could not reverse a voluntary resignation(¶194).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

17,10-05-2023,ADIVASIS FOR SOCIAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTION vs UNION OF INDIAC.A. No. 2202/2012,Applicability of laws and rights of non-tribals within Scheduled Areas.,"ADIVASIS FOR SOCIAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTION V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 512 (10 May 2023)Justices:  Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Rajesh BindalQuestion(s):  (i) WhetherUnion and State laws can apply to a Scheduled Area unless a specific notification making the said laws applicable to the Scheduled Area is issued by the Governor of that State. (ii) Whether persons who are not members of a Scheduled Tribe have the right to settle down in Scheduled Areas. (iii) Should non-Scheduled Tribe candidates have the right to vote in or to contest the elections of the Legislative Assembly or the Lok Sabha from the Scheduled Area? Factual Background:  On 31 December 1977, the President of India declared the entire district of Sundargarh in the State of Orissa as a Scheduled Area under Clause 6(2) of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India. A Scheduled Area is an area consisting of a significant population of tribal communities. The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution empowers the President to declare certain areas within States as Scheduled Areas to safeguard the interest and welfare of the tribal communities in that area. The Governor has the power to alter the applicability of Central and State laws to Scheduled Areas by issuing a notification under Clause 5(1) of the Fifth Schedule.The Petitioner was a society representing the interests and fundamental rights of Scheduled Tribes. They approached the High Court of Orissa by way of a writ petition contending that only members of Scheduled Tribes had the right to reside and vote in Scheduled Areas. The Petitioner also submitted that no law made by Parliament or the State Legislature would apply to such Scheduled Areas unless the Governor issued a notification under the Fifth Schedule. The High Court dismissed the writ petition. The Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the Central and the State laws which are applicable to the State of Orissa will continue to apply to Scheduled Areas in the State of Orissa unless the Governor, under Clause 5(1) of the Fifth Schedule, declares that a particular law is not applicable to the Scheduled Area. The Supreme Court held that non-tribals have the right to settle down in a Scheduled Area based on Article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution of India which grants every citizen a right to settle in any part of the territory of India. Further, any person including non-tribals have a right to vote even in Scheduled Areas. There is no provision that all the constituencies for Lok Sabha and State Legislature elections in Scheduled Areas are reserved only for Scheduled Tribes candidates. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Oka.Reasons for the Decision:  Applicability of Union and State Laws to a Scheduled AreaThe major question of law in this case was whether Union and State laws would apply in a Scheduled Area without a specific notification issued by the Governor (¶7). Clause 5 of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution was held to mean that the Governormay, by public notification, direct that any particular law of Parliament or the State Legislature shall not apply to a Scheduled Area or shall apply to such Scheduled Area with some modifications (¶8).The Supreme Court referred to the Constitution Bench judgment of the Supreme Court in Chebrolu Leela Prasad Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2020 INSC 344) and held that this judgment clearly clarified that all Central and State laws are automatically applicable to a Scheduled Area unless the Governor issued a notification under Clause 5 of the Fifth Schedule or introduced some modifications to that law in its application to the Scheduled Area (¶11). Therefore, the power of the Governor under Clause 5 of the Fifth Schedule is restricted to directing that a particular Union or State law will not apply in a Scheduled Area or that it shall apply with certain modifications (¶13).Power of Governor and Fundamental RightsThe Supreme Court held that the exercise of powerbythe GovernorunderClause5 of the Fifth Schedule cannot override or violate the Fundamental Rights under Part III of the Constitution of India (¶11). This power of the Governor is equivalent to the power of the Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws and the power should only be exercised subject to the Fundamental Rights and other provisions of the Constitution (¶13).Right to Vote and Reservations in Scheduled AreasThe Supreme Court stated that the right to vote was governed by Part III of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (“RPA 1950”). The RPA 1950 did not restrict voting rights in Scheduled Areas to only tribal populations. Therefore, any Indian citizen who is eligible to vote, including a non-tribal, can vote in a Scheduled Area (¶16).The Supreme Court noted that reservation for constituencies was to be made in terms of Article 330 and 332 of the Constitution of India and these provisions did not provide that all the constituencies in Scheduled Areas should be reserved for Scheduled Tribes (¶17). The Delimitation Act of 2002 applied to Scheduled Areas and even this did not provide for specific reservations for Scheduled Tribes in Scheduled Areas (¶17).Prepared by Hiteshi Sharma (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

18,01-05-2023,SHILPA SAILESH vs VARUN SREENIVASANT.P.(C) No. 1118/2014,Power of the Supreme Court to grant a divorce based on the consent of the parties under Article 142 of the Constitution.,"SHILPA SAILESH V. VARUN SREENIVASAN2023 INSC 468 (1 May 2023)Justices:  Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Jitendra K. MaheshwariQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the Supreme Court can, under Article 142 of the Constitution, grant divorce based on the mutual consent of the parties, bypassing the waiting period under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, (“HMA”), and also quash other connected proceedings. If yes, what are the contours of this power? (ii) Can the Supreme Court grant divorce under Article 142 despite one spouse's objection, in cases of irretrievable breakdown of marriage?Factual Background:  A transfer petition was filed in the Supreme Court for the transfer of divorce proceedings from one state to another. During the course of proceedings, the parties agreed to divorce by mutual consent and arrived at a settlement. The parties sought the Supreme Court’s intervention under Article 142 of the Indian Constitution to dissolve their marriage. Article 142(1) of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to do ‘complete justice’ in ‘any cause or matter’ before it.A Division Bench of the Supreme Court (two judges) found that there was an irretrievable breakdown in the marriage. Recognizing the backlog in family courts, the Supreme Court dissolved the marriage under Article 142, bypassing the lengthy process in the family court under the HMA.The Supreme Court acknowledged a surge in similar cases before the Supreme Court seeking relief under Article 142. On 29 June 2016, the bench referred the matter to a Constitution Bench (five judges) to clarify the scope of the Court's power under Article 142 of the Constitution.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench held that the Supreme Court can record the settlement between the parties and dissolve the marriage by passing a decree of divorce by mutual consent in exercise of power under Article 142 of the Constitution without being bound by the procedural requirement under the HMA. The Court also held that while exercising powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Court can quash and set aside other proceedings between the parties, including criminal proceedings.Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that under Article 142(1) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court could grant divorce if a marriage has irretrievably broken down, even if one party opposes the prayer for divorce. Finally, the Court clarified that parties could not approach the Supreme Court directly to dissolve the marriage under Article 142. Rather, parties would have to approach the Family Court as the court of first instance.The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Sanjiv Khanna.Reasons for the Decision:  The scope and ambit of power of Supreme Court under Article 142(1) of the Constitution of IndiaThe Supreme Court held that Article 142(1) of the Constitution gives wide power to the Supreme Court to do ‘complete justice’ in any ‘cause or matter.’ The Court held that this power, while broad, is restrained by fundamental considerations of general public policy (fundamental rights, secularism, federalism, and other basic features of the Constitution of India) and specific public policy (e.g some express prohibition in any statute) (¶13). It was held that while the Court cannot create new laws or disregard explicit statutory provisions, it can intervene in areas where the law is unclear. As long as the Court's actions uphold these fundamental principles the Court may deviate from procedural and substantive laws to do ‘complete justice’ between parties (¶13).Supreme Court can grant a decree of divorce under Article 142(1)Section 13-B of the HMA provides for divorce by mutual consent, subject to a mandatory cooling-off period of minimum six months and maximum eighteen months. The Supreme Court clarified that the cooling off period of six months can be waived in exceptional situations where prolonged court proceedings have already caused significant distress to the parties (¶17). The purpose of the cooling-off period is not to prolong suffering or salvage irreparably broken marriages (¶17). If reconciliation efforts fail and the marriage is totally unworkable, then the Court can grant divorce without waiting for the cooling-off period (¶¶16-17, ¶22).The Supreme Court finally held that while exercising powers under Article 142(1) of the Constitution, it can grant divorce based on mutual consent without requiring parties to file joint motions before the trial court (¶18). Even if the main case is pending elsewhere, the Supreme Court's power extends to granting divorce by mutual consent, thereby easing the burden on multiple courts and the parties (¶19). Based on the settlement reached between the parties, the Court has the power to appropriately deal with other pending proceedings between them, whether civil or criminal (¶22).Court can grant of divorce under Article 142(1) even if one spouse opposes such prayerThe Supreme Court held that under Article 142, it can dissolve the marriage (on grounds of an irretrievable breakdown of marriage) even without the consent of both the parties (¶32). However, it observed that such a remedy could not be claimed as a right but was a discretionary power of the Court, requiring careful consideration of several factors. Factors like duration of marriage, long separation period, nature of allegations, attempts at reconciliation, the orders passed in the legal proceedings from time to time, must be assessed cumulatively (¶33). These facts have to be evaluated keeping in view the economic and social status of the parties, including their educational qualifications, whether the parties have any children, their age, whether spouse and children are dependent. Custody of children, alimony, and other pending matters are also relevant (¶33).A party cannot directly approach the Supreme Court by filing a writ petition to seek divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriageThe Supreme Court held that if a party is aggrieved by the order of a court, they cannot directly approach the Supreme Court or High Court and seek divorce on ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage through writ petitions under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution (¶41). Instead, they must appeal to the appropriate superior court or tribunal (¶41). The writ jurisdiction of the High Courts and Supreme Court is meant for enforcing fundamental rights under Part III of the Constitution, not for challenging judicial orders. Therefore, relief of divorce cannot be directly sought through Article 32 of the Constitution (¶41).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

19,05-04-2023,MADHYAMAM BROADCASTING LIMITED vs UNION OF INDIAC.A. No. 8129/2022,Constitutional challenge to the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's restrictions on the operation of the Media One television channel.,"MADHYAMAM BROADCASTING LIMITED V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 324 (5 April 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud and Justice Hima KohliQuestion(s):  Is the order issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (“MIB”) refusing to renew the uplinking and downlinking permission granted to Madhyamam Broadcasting Ltd. (“MBL”) to operate the television channel Media One violative of MBL’s right to freedom of expression under the Constitution?Factual Background:  On 19 April 2010, MBL applied for permission to uplink and downlink its news and current affairs television channel named ‘Media One’. On 30 September 2011, MIB gave MBL permission to uplink Media One for a period of ten years under the ‘Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channels from India’.On 3 May 2021, MBL applied for a renewal of the permission granted to Media One. MIB issued a show cause notice to MBL as to why the permission granted to them should not be revoked since the Ministry of Home Affairs (“MHA”) had denied security clearance to MBL.On 31 Jan 2022, MIB revoked MBL’s permission for uplinking and downlinking Media One. The reason given was that due to denial of security clearance, the company ceased to fulfil the eligibility requirement for renewal of permission for uplinking and downlinking of TV Channels.MBL filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Kerala challenging MIB’s order revoking the uplinking and downlinking permission for Media One. The Union of India’s submissions were made through a ‘sealed cover’ (i.e., they were not made available to MBL or the public). The Union told the High Court that security clearance was denied to MBL based on inputs given by the Intelligence Bureau (“IB”), which are sensitive and secret in nature. It was further stated that MHA cannot disclose reasons for the denial of security clearance for national security reasons.On 8 February 2022, a Single Judge of the High Court of Kerala dismissed the writ petition. The Single Judge’s decision was challenged before the Division Bench (two judges) of the High Court. On 2 March 2022, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal. MBL appealed against the decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala to the Supreme Court. Before the Supreme Court the Union Government contended that MBL had close ties to Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (“JEI-H”) and hence was a security threat.On 15 March 2022, the Supreme Court said that the issue as to whether the contents of the sensitive files (which were submitted in a sealed cover before the High Court) should be disclosed to the Petitioners will be decided by the Supreme Court’s final judgement.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that MIB’s order revoking MBL’s permission for uplinking and downlinking Media One was unconstitutional. The judgement of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.The Supreme Court held that MBL’s right to a fair hearing has been infringed because: (i) MIB’s order revoking Media One’s license did not contain any reasons for denial of security clearance and (ii) the Union’s reasons were not disclosed to MBL and were only disclosed to the Court. The Supreme Court further held that the non-renewal of permission to operate a media channel is a restriction on the freedom of the press which can only be reasonably restricted on the grounds stipulated in Article 19(2) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that Media One’s alleged anti-establishment stance and the alleged link of the shareholders of the channel to JEI-H are not legitimate reasons to restrict the right of freedom of speech. The Court directed MIB to proceed with the issuing of renewal permissions in accordance with the Court’s judgment within four weeks.Reasons for the Decision:  The Supreme Court noted that Paragraph 10 of the ‘Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channels from India’ sets out the conditions for renewal of existing permissions. Paragraph 10.2 of the Uplinking Guidelines states that the channel should not have violated the Programme Code on more than five occasions. The Court found that Media One had not violated the Programme Code on five or more occasions (¶¶23-26).Reasons for denial of security clearance must be providedThe Supreme Court noted that the MHA only revealed its reasons for denying security clearance to the High Court, and MBL was not given even a summary of these reasons. This, according to the Court, undermined the freedom of the press under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and denied a fair avenue to challenge the MIB’s decision, which infringed MBL’s right to a fair hearing (¶57). The Court stated that the summary of reasons for denying security clearance constitutes the bare minimum procedural safeguards, and the MHA's failure to disclose its reasons represents an unreasonable and arbitrary approach (¶102).The Supreme Court disapproved of the practice of accepting evidence in sealed cover. It stated that the non-disclosure of reasons for denial of security clearance to MBL and the disclosure solely to the Court in a sealed cover compromised the core principles of natural justice (¶58). It was held that when relevant material is disclosed in a sealed cover, it perpetuates a culture of secrecy and opaqueness, and makes it hard for the aggrieved party (in this case MBL) to challenge the judgement (¶59).Incorrect reasoning to deny security clearanceThe Supreme Court observed that security clearance was denied to MBL because of an alleged link between the shareholders of Media One and JEI-H, and its alleged anti-establishment stance. The Court found that the IB had solely relied on the content and ‘tenor’ of MBL’s published articles, and content of Media One's broadcasted programs to establish a link between MBL and JEI-H (¶98). The Court held that firstly, JEI-H is not a banned organisation, and therefore, the contention that links with JEI-H will affect national security cannot be accepted, and secondly, there is no material to prove that the shareholders of MBL are sympathizers of JEI-H (¶168). It was also held that the report of IB is purely an inference drawn from information that is already in the public domain and that there is nothing ‘secretive’ about this information to attract the ground of confidentiality (¶99).On the matter of the confidentiality of IB Reports, the Court held that absolute immunity from disclosure for reports by investigative agencies is antithetical to a transparent and accountable system, as these reports significantly impact individuals’ lives, liberties, and professions (¶81).The Supreme Court also noted that national security claims cannot be made out of thin air. There must be concrete intelligence material backing such an allegation. The Court held that the material produced by the Union of India had no nexus with the national security threat raised (¶99).Freedom of the pressThe Supreme Court criticized the denial of security clearance to Media One on the basis of the views which the channel is constitutionally entitled to hold, expressing concern over the chilling effect on free speech and press freedom. The Court clarified that criticism of governmental policy is not a permissible reason to restrict expression under Article 19(2) of the Constitution (¶167).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

20,21-03-2023,SUNDAR @ SUNDARRAJAN vs STATE BY INSPECTOR OF POLICER.P.(Crl.) No. 159-160/2013 In Crl.A. No. 300-301/2011,Significance of mitigating factors when awarding the death penalty.,"SUNDAR @ SUNDARRAJAN V. STATE BY INSPECTOR OF POLICE2023 INSC 264 (21 March 2023)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hima Kohli, Justice Pamidighantam S. NarasimhaQuestion(s):  (i) Should the Supreme Court review the Petitioner’s conviction for kidnapping and murder (under Sections 364A and 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860)? (ii) Is the award of the death penalty to the Petitioner justified? Factual Background:  On 27 July 2009, the Petitioner kidnapped a seven-year-old child in Kammapuram, Tamil Nadu. He made two calls to the victim’s mother, demanding a ransom of Rs 5 lakhs. On 30 July 2009, the police raided the house of the Petitioner and arrested him and a co-accused. The Petitioner confessed to strangling the child and disposing of his body in a tank. On the basis of the Petitioner’s confession, the police recovered the victim’s body from the tank.The Trial Court at Cuddalore found the Petitioner guilty of kidnapping and murdering the child. He was convicted for kidnapping and murder under Sections 364A and 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to death. The co-accused was acquitted of all offences.The Petitioner appealed his conviction before the Madras High Court unsuccessfully. An appeal to the Supreme Court before a Division Bench (two judges) was also dismissed. Both the appellate courts upheld the conviction and the award of the death penalty by the Trial Court.In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Mohd. Arif alias Ashfaq v. Registrar, Supreme Court of India,(2014 INSC 590) petitions seeking a review of sentences of death penalty were required to be heard in open court. The Petitioner argued that his conviction warranted a review since it suffered from judicial errors. He argued that even if his guilt were established, the Courts had failed to consider mitigating circumstances in awarding him the death penalty, and his sentence ought to be commuted. The State of Tamil Nadu urged that the errors alleged did not warrant an exercise of the Supreme Court’s narrow review jurisdiction.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the Petitioner for kidnapping and murder. However, it found that neither the Trial Court nor the appellate courts had considered mitigating circumstances in awarding the death penalty to the Petitioner, which was only appropriate in the rarest of rare cases. The Supreme Court commuted the sentence of the Petitioner to life imprisonment for not less than twenty years without remission. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  No errors apparent on the face of the recordThe Court found that the Petitioner had failed to raise a reasonable doubt about the prosecution’s case, which was based on strong witness testimonies and documentary evidence (¶¶52-53). Satisfied with the concurrent findings of the Trial Court, the High Court, and its Division Bench, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the Petitioner for kidnapping and murder (¶93).Consideration of mitigating and aggravating circumstancesThe Supreme Court found that the Trial Court had not granted the Petitioner a meaningful hearing on sentencing before awarding the death penalty (¶¶70-71). Neither the Trial Court nor the appellate courts had made a genuine effort to consider mitigating circumstances that suggested the possibility of reform or rehabilitation for the Petitioner (¶79). Instead, the penalty had been imposed and confirmed solely on the basis of the gruesome nature of the crime (¶¶71-72, 81). The Division Bench of the Supreme Court had reasoned that the Petitioner’s decision to target the only son of a family, who would have carried on the family lineage, was an aggravating circumstance (¶75).Citing its previous judgments, the Supreme Court emphasised that it was the duty of a court to inquire into the mitigating circumstances of a criminal, and rule out the possibility of their reformation and rehabilitation before awarding the death penalty (¶81). This duty was to be discharged even if the accused was silent (¶80). Further, the Court noted that the murder of the child, regardless of its sex was an aggravating circumstance and that courts should not make patriarchal value judgments that encourage the notion that only a son furthers his family lineage (¶75).The Supreme Court ruled that despite the grave crime committed by the Petitioner, the death penalty was to be awarded only in the “rarest of rare cases,” (Bachan Sigh v. State of Punjab 1980 INSC 120) and was not appropriate in the present case (¶77). The Court considered mitigating factors, noting that the Petitioner was twenty-three years old when he committed the crime and had no previous criminal antecedents (¶88). It noted that he had been in prison since 2009, where his conduct had been satisfactory, except for an attempted escape in 2013 (¶88). The Petitioner had earned a diploma in food catering while in jail and was suffering from systemic hypertension (¶88). In view of these circumstances, the Court commuted the Petitioner’s sentence to life imprisonment of not less than twenty years without remission (¶92). It noted that although life sentences subject to remission usually work out to fourteen years, this shorter sentence was inadequate in view of the grave crime committed (¶91).Prepared by Hiteshi Sharma (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

No. 3187-3188/1988 and SLP (C) No. 13080/1988,Plea to increase the amount of compensation for victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy.,"UNION OF INDIA . V. M/S. UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION2023 INSC 222 (14 March 2023)Justices:  Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Jitendra K. MaheshwariQuestion(s):  Whether the settlement order passed by the Supreme Court against Union Carbide Corporation for the Bhopal Gas Tragedy disaster can be reconsidered to increase the settlement amount.Factual Background:  On the night of 2-3 December 1984, the escape of deadly chemical fumes from Union Carbide India Limited’s (“Union Carbide India”) pesticide factory in Bhopal led to the deaths of around 3,000 people and serious injuries to over 30,000 others. In order to provide relief and remuneration to the large number of victims, the Government of India enacted the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act, 1985 (“Bhopal Claims Act”). Under the Act, the Union Government assumed the exclusive right to represent every person who was entitled to claim compensation. The Bhopal Claims Act also allowed the Union Government to file cases for claims and to enter into a compromise with Union Carbide India on behalf of the victims. Union Carbide Corporation (“Union Carbide USA”), an American corporation owned a majority of the shares of Union Carbide India. So, the Union Government instituted a case against Union Carbide USA in India for compensation.After proceedings before the District Court in Bhopal and the Madhya Pradesh High Court in which both courts awarded different amounts of interim compensation to be paid by Union Carbide USA, both the Union Government and Union Carbide USA filed petitions before the Supreme Court of India. Later, Union Carbide USA and the Union Government entered into a negotiated settlement in February 1989 whereby Union Carbide USA agreed to pay $470 million to the Union Government as a final settlement for all claims and liabilities arising out of the Bhopal Gas disaster. The amount was calculated to ensure urgent relief to the victims and was required to be deposited by 31 March 1989. Upon payment of the settlement amount, all civil and criminal cases related to the disaster were to be closed. The Supreme Court approved of the settlement in Union Carbide Corporation v. Union of India (1989 INSC 60) (“UCC case”). In its judgment, the Supreme Court also stated that in the unlikely situation of the settlement fund being insufficient to provide compensation to the victims, the Union of India should provide for the deficiency.In the present case, the Union Government had filed a curative petition before the Supreme Court in 2010 seeking to reopen the case and reconsider the settlement amount. The Union Government requested the Court to increase the settlement amount against Union Carbide USA following new facts and data relating to the number of deaths and injuries.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court passed a unanimous judgment rejecting the curative petition filed by the Union of India. The Supreme Court held there was no legal principle that justified an increase in compensation. The Supreme Court also refused to increase the settlement amount using its discretionary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The decision of the Court was authored by Justice Kaul. Reasons for the Decision:  Maintainability of the Curative PetitionThe Supreme Court observed that a curative petition could be filed only on a very limited number of grounds in order to rectify a gross miscarriage of justice that was not previously recognised by the Court during its re.The Supreme Court noted that the curative petition would lead to a re-examination of its final judgment in the UCC case (¶26). The Court said that the scope of review in a curative petition was very limited (¶26). The Court held that increasing the settlement through a curative petition would exceed the purpose of such a petition (¶26). However, the Court agreed to examine the petition on its merits because of the importance of the matter (¶29).Adequacy of the settlement amountThe Union of India submitted that the curative petition was filed because the settlement amount agreed to was based on wrong facts and data that underestimated the number of victims and the extent of monetary loss caused to them by the disaster (¶15). The Union Government stated that it did not want to reopen the suit but to increase the underlying settlement amount of $470 million in light of the additional amounts claimed (¶¶15, 18).The Supreme Court noted that the Union Government had opposed earlier claims by private organisations which sought to enhance the amount of the settlement fund (¶30). The Court also observed that the disbursement of individual compensation amounts from the settlement fund had increased as the exchange rate fluctuations of the Indian rupee against the US dollar had led to an increase in the amount available to the Union Government (¶¶42, 43). The Court also noted that the Welfare Commissioner under the Bhopal Claims Act had adjudicated the claims as per the law and that the Supreme Court itself had previously found that the compensation provided was more than what was reasonably available to the victims under the law (¶45). Thus, according to the Court, all these observations reinforced the fact that the settlement amount was sufficient to compensate the victims (¶45).Responsibility of the Union GovernmentThe Supreme Court also found that the Supreme Court had previously directed the Union of India, being a welfare state, to take out relevant insurance policies on behalf of future victims who were later born with or developed any disabilities due to the disaster in order to fulfil any future deficiency in the compensation (¶46). The Court criticised the Union of India and said it was grossly negligent since it had failed to take out any such insurance policies (¶46). Moreover, the Court noted that a sum of Rs. 50 crore was still lying undisbursed with the Reserve Bank of India to take care of victims and ordered that this amount be utilised in accordance with the Bhopal Claims Act in case of additional expenses (¶48).Additional observationsThe Supreme Court observed that there had been no allegations of fraud committed by Union Carbide USA while negotiating the settlement amount and legally, a settlement could only be set aside in cases of fraud (¶47). The Court held that it would not be appropriate to use its inherent powers to do justice under Article 142 of the Constitution in this case (¶47). Finally, the Court noted that it was necessary to provide closure in this case since otherwise, every private claimant could also start to lead evidence for extra monetary damages and this would lead to inevitable judicial delay that would favour UCC instead of the beneficiaries (¶49).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

22,02-03-2023,ANOOP BARANWAL vs UNION OF INDIA MINISTRY OF LAW AND JUSTICE SECRETARYW.P.(C) No. 104/2015,Challenge to the procedure for appointing Members of the Election Commission of India (ECI).,"ANOOP BARANWAL V. UNION OF INDIA MINISTRY OF LAW AND JUSTICE SECRETARY2023 INSC 190 (2 March 2023)Justices:  Justice Kurian M. Joseph, Justice Ajay Rastogi, Justice Aniruddha Bose, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Chudalayil T. RavikumarQuestion(s):  Whether the Supreme Court is required to pass any directions to ensure the independence of the Election Commission of India (“ECI”) given that Parliament has not passed any law under Article 324 specifying the appointment process for Members of the ECI.Factual Background:  Article 324 of the Constitution states that the ECI shall supervise and control elections. Article 324(2) specifically provides that the President is responsible for appointing the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners, subject to any law enacted by Parliament. Parliament had not made any law for the appointment of ECI Members. In the absence of such legislation, the President has been making appointments based on the Prime Minister's recommendations.Several Writ Petitions were filed in the Supreme Court asserting that the existing procedure for appointing members to the ECI is unconstitutional. The Petitioners contended that under the existing system, the executive government exclusively holds the authority for appointments, which is eroding the ECI's independence. The Petitioners requested the Supreme Court to issue directions for the establishment of an independent system for ECI appointments. The Union of India responded saying that judicial intervention in the appointment procedure of ECI members would violate the separation of powers and even under the current appointment process, the ECI has been able to demonstrate its independence as free, fair, and timely elections have been held.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Petitioners and laid down guidelines to constitute a selection committee consisting of the Prime Minister of India, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India for appointing ECI members until a law is made by the Parliament. The Court concluded that the framers of the Constitution clearly contemplated a law by Parliament under Article 324 and did not intend the executive to exclusively make appointments to the Election Commission. Seven decades have passed and no law has been framed. There is a clear legislative vacuum and continuing appointments to the ECI solely by the executive will have an adverse effect on the fundamental rights of the people and democracy. Hence, the Supreme Court held that it was appropriate for the Court to lay down norms for the appointment of ECI Members which will be effective until Parliament passes a law. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice K.M. Joseph. Justice Ajay Rastogi wrote a concurring but separate opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  Framers of the Constitution sought to protect ECI’s independenceThe Supreme Court referred to the Constituent Assembly Debates of 1949 to determine the intent of the Constitution’s framers. Dr B. R. Ambedkar pointed out that the election machinery should not be under the control of the government of the day, and the elections should be conducted by an independent body called the Election Commission (¶30). The Court found that it is clear that the Members of the Constituent Assembly did not want the appointment to the Election Commission to be made solely by the executive (¶32). The Court Bench found that the phrase ‘subject to the provisions of any law to be made by the Parliament’ in Article 324(2) demonstrated the intention of the framers of the Constitution to ensure the independence of the ECI but leave the specific appointment process for Parliament to prescribe by law (¶33).The Supreme Court observed that the framers of the Constitution clearly intended that Parliament would step-in and make a law, and that the appointment by the executive was a mere transient or stop-gap arrangement to be replaced by a law taking away the exclusive power of the executive to appoint ECI members (¶227). The absence of law even after seven decades creates a legislative vacuum which makes it necessary for the Court to step in and provide guidelines (¶227).Additional reasons to protect ECI’s independenceThe Supreme Court noted that Article 324 gives the ECI the entire responsibility to hold the national and state elections and carries with it the necessary powers to discharge this function (¶150). The Court held that since the ECI discharges such important functions integral to democratic process in the country, the ECI should be independent, fair, and follow the rule of law (¶165). The Court noted that an Election Commission which does not ensure free and fair polls, guarantees the breakdown of the rule of law (¶219).The Supreme Court noted that the ECI needs to be free from executive control because (i) a party in power naturally has an incentive to remain in power and may seek to interfere with the ECI’s independence to retain power (¶222); (ii) if the Election Commission exercises their powers unfairly or illegally then it has a chilling effect on the fortunes of political parties and inequality in the treatment of political parties would violate the principle of equality under Article 14 (¶165); and (iii) Justice Ajay Rastogi’s separate opinion emphasised the need for objective selection of ECI members to ensure transparency and accountability (¶28 J. Rastogi).Composition of independent commissionThe Supreme Court took note of the fact that the appointment of the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation is made on the recommendation of a committee consisting of the Prime Minister as the Chairperson, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated by him. Similarly, in the appointment of the Chairperson and Members of the Lokpal, under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, the Chief Justice is one of the five members of a selection committee. The Court also took note of the Report of the Goswami Committee and the Two Hundred and Fifty-Fifth Law Commission Report to come up with the selection committee for the appointment of ECI members (¶229).Justice Ajay Rastogi in his separate opinion undertook a comparative analysis of the appointment of the head of election-conducting bodies across the world and noted that in most jurisdictions, such appointments are a consultative process, involving members of both the ruling party and the opposition party (¶107 J. Rastogi). The opposition's presence in decision-making processes of governance is essential for a healthy democracy, ensuring accountability and fostering deliberative processes (¶107 J. Rastogi). He also noted that some jurisdictions have constitutional functionaries such as Speakers of the house of the legislature, and judges of the highest court in the country in a multi-member committee (¶107 J. Rastogi).Short terms undermine independenceThe Supreme Court noted that according to Section 4 of the Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and Transaction of Business Act, 1991, an Election Commissioner is entitled to a term of six years subject to the condition that the officer would have to vacate the office upon his reaching the age of sixty-five years (¶189). The Court noted that the Union Government has constantly been choosing members who are close to attaining the age of sixty-five since 2004 (¶52). The Court observed that the condition of having a tenure less than six years should be an exception and not the norm. The Court found that short terms undermined the independence of the Election Commission and defeated the policy of independence (¶195).Additional observationsThe Supreme Court noted that the grounds of removal of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) are the same as that of a Supreme Court judge i.e. removal by a resolution by a two-thirds majority of Parliament on the ground of proven misbehaviour or incapacity. However, an Election Commissioner can be removed on the recommendation of the CEC. The Court held that there is no need to make the removal process for Election Commissioners the same as that of the CEC (¶233).Justice Ajay Rastogi in his separate opinion suggested that the grounds of removal of the Election Commissioners should be the same as that of the CEC to ensure the neutrality and independence of the office (¶125 J. Rastogi).The Petitioners sought a direction from the Supreme Court that the ECI be provided with a permanent Secretariat and its expenses charged to the Consolidated Fund of India. The Court noted that it was a matter of policy that can be provided for by a law (¶239).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

23,20-02-2023,APARNA AJINKYA FIRODIA vs AJINKYA ARUN FIRODIAC.A. No. 1308/2023,Challenge to DNA test on child to prove adultery.,"APARNA AJINKYA FIRODIA V. AJINKYA ARUN FIRODIA2023 INSC 146 (20 February 2023)Justices:  Justice V. Ramasubramanian, Justice B. V. NagarathnaQuestion(s):  Whether DNA test of a child can be directed in divorce proceedings to prove the ground of adultery.Factual Background:  The husband (Respondent) in an ongoing divorce proceeding filed an application to ascertain the paternity of the second child born to his wife during their marriage by a deoxyribonucleic acid test (“DNA test”). The Family Court allowed it and the decision was affirmed by the Bombay High Court.The wife (Petitioner) approached the Supreme Court against the decision of the Bombay High Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that in this case it is not in the best interest of the child to allow the DNA test because the ultimate object for demanding DNA test is not for determining parentage of the child but for proving allegations of adultery (extramarital relations) during the marriage, which can be proved by adducing any other evidence. The Court also held that children have the right not to have their legitimacy questioned frivolously before a court of law. This is an essential attribute of their right to privacy. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice B.V. Nagarathna and signed by Justice V. Ramasubramanian. Justice V. Ramasubramanian also wrote a separate concurring opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  DNA Tests of Children : PrinciplesJustice Nagarathna summarised the principles of when a Court should direct a DNA test on a minor (¶12):DNA tests of children shall not be conducted in a routine manner in case of matrimonial disputes unless there is no other way of proving infidelity .Section 112 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides that a child born during a valid marriage is considered to be the legitimate child of the husband. A DNA test of a child born during continuance of a valid marriage can only be directed when the husband can prove he did not have access to the wife.No DNA Test is justified when paternity of a child is not directly in issue, but is merely collateral to the proceeding .While directing DNA tests to prove adultery, the Court should consider the consequences on the children born out of adultery, including inheritance-related consequences and social stigma.Right to Privacy of ChildrenThe Supreme Court noted that a child's right to privacy is not equal to that of an adult. However, children have their own identity, and Article 8 of the United Nations Convention on Rights of Child provides children with an express right to preserve their identity (¶21). The Court noted that one's genetic information is personal and intimate and is protected by the right to privacy applicable to children(¶16). The Court held that the details of their parentage form an essential attribute of a child's identity and therefore they should not be challenged frivolously before the courts (¶21).Best interests of a childThe Supreme Court stated that the interest of the child should be given primary consideration in actions involving children. The Court noted that a revelation of illegitimacy of a child through a DNA test can not only cause confusion in the mind of the child but a quest to find out who is his/her real father (¶22). The Court observed that not knowing who one’s father is creates a mental trauma in a child, and may lead to a bittering relationship between the child and parents (¶22.3). Further, this also creates lots of social stigma towards both the child and the mother. Hence, the Court held that a parent may, in the best interests of the child, choose not to subject a child to a DNA test (¶22.3).Justice V. Ramasubramanian in his separate opinion observed that whether DNA tests should be allowed or not should be decided by looking from the child's perspective and not from the perspective of the parents (¶33 J. Ramasubramanian). The child cannot be used as a means to prove adulterous (out of marriage) relations. The adulterous conduct of the wife can be proved by the respondent by advancing other evidence but the identity of the child should not be compromised (¶33 J. Ramasubramanian).Adverse inference cannot be drawnJ. Ramasubramanian in his separate opinion took note of Illustration (h) under Section 114 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It says that if a man refuses to answer a question which he is not compelled to answer by law, the Court may presume that the answer, if given, would be unfavourable to him (¶16 J. Ramasubramanian). J. Ramasubramanian held that if the wife raises an objection as to the DNA test of the child for her benefit, then the presumption under Section 114, illustration (h) can be raised against her. However, if the wife raises objections as to the DNA test of the child in the capacity of a mother for the benefit of her child then no presumption under the said provision can be drawn against her (¶28 J. Ramasubramanian).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

24,10-02-2023,BAR COUNCIL OF INDIA vs BONNIE FOI LAW COLLEGE .C.A. No. 969/2023,Power of the Bar Council of India to prescribe a qualifying exam to practice as an advocate.,"BAR COUNCIL OF INDIA V. BONNIE FOI LAW COLLEGE .2023 INSC 116 (10 February 2023)Justices:  Justice Sanjay K. Kaul, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Jitendra K. MaheshwariQuestion(s):  Whether the Bar Council of India can prescribe either a pre-enrolment or a post-enrolment examination (like the All India Bar Examination) as a necessary condition for practising as an advocate.Factual Background:  Bonnie Foi Law College (“College”) applied to the Bar Council of India (“BCI”) to offer a law degree course. A dispute arose between the BCI and the College. In 2009, the Supreme Court appointed an inspection team which visited the College and gave a report pointing out shortcomings in the infrastructure and functioning of the college.During this matter, a larger question of diminishing standards of legal education provided at various law colleges in India came before the Supreme Court. The Court appointed a three-member Committee to examine issues relating to affiliation and recognition of law colleges and to identify areas of improvement. The report submitted by this committee led to the first All India Bar Examination (“AIBE”) being conducted in 2010, by a specially constituted independent body consisting of experts of various disciplines.During the hearing, a case of V. Sudeer v. Bar Council of India (1999 INSC 105) (“V. Sudeer”) came up for reconsideration, the Supreme Court in V. Sudeer held that the BCI has no power under Advocates Act to prescribe rules for a pre-enrolment training or examination as a necessary condition for practice as an advocate.In 2016, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court opined that the questions in the present matter are of considerable importance affecting the legal profession in general and need to be authoritatively answered by a Constitution Bench.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the BCI has the power to prescribe a post-enrolment examination like the All India Bar Examination as a necessary condition to practice as an advocate. The Court held that the BCI also has the power to prescribe a pre-enrolment examination or necessary pre-enrolment training as a condition for practicing as an advocate. The Court declared that the decision in V. Sudeer was incorrect. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Sanjay K. Kaul.Reasons for the Decision:  Scope of BCI’s powers under Advocates Act, 1961The Supreme Court took note of Section 7 of the Advocates Act, 1961 (“Advocates Act”) which provides for functions of the BCI. In particular, Section 7(1)(h) provides for the promotion of legal education and for the laying down of standards for such education in consultation with Universities in India and State Bar Councils (¶20). The Court also noted that Section 49 of the Advocates Act deals with the general powers of BCI to make rules and Section 49(1)(ah) & (ag) specifically deals with the conditions subject to which an Advocate shall have the right to practise (¶¶26-27). The Court held that considering Section 7 and Section 49 of Advocates Act, the BCI has powers to provide for a pre-enrolment training course or an examination for enrolment of advocates as the BCI is directly concerned with the standard of persons who want to obtain a licence to practice law as a profession (¶¶20, 31-32). The Court declared that it is left to the BCI to decide at what stage the All-India Bar Examination will be held, that is, pre-enrolment or post-enrolment (¶35).Need for Quality Control of LawyersThe Supreme Court noted that quality of lawyers is an important aspect of administration of justice and access to justice (¶9). The Court held that quality control of lawyers entering into the profession is the need of the hour and a provision of an All India Bar Examination for enrolment serves the purpose (¶32).Suggestions to the BCI regarding conduct of AIBEThe Supreme Court, while upholding the validity of AIBE, gave certain suggestions to the BCI regarding the conduct of the examination:The schedule of conducting AIBE twice in a year should be strictly followed as otherwise the students with law degrees would be unable to practice (¶36).Students in the final Semester of course of law could be allowed to take AIBE and the result of AIBE would be subject to passing all college examinations (¶38).Any law graduate who is yet to appear for AIBE or get enrolled under the Advocates Act, 1961 should be able to do all the tasks allied to the legal profession other than pleading before the courts (¶39).Lawyers who are in non-legal jobs for a certain number of years should re-qualify AIBE to rejoin the legal profession (¶42).Different State Bar Councils are charging different fees for enrolment. The BCI must make sure that a uniform pattern is observed and the fee does not become oppressive at the threshold of young students joining the profession (¶44).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

25,31-01-2023,JOSEPH SHINE vs UNION OF INDIA SECRETARYMA 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.) No. 194/2017,Clarification regarding the applicability of the offence of adultery to the armed forces after the offence was declared unconstitutional.,"JOSEPH SHINE V. UNION OF INDIA SECRETARY2023 INSC 87 (31 January 2023)Justices:  Justice Kuttiyil M. Joseph, Justice Ajay Rastogi, Justice Aniruddha Bose, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Chudalayil T. RavikumarQuestion(s):  Whether the Supreme Court’s judgment in Joseph Shine v. Union of India (“2018 Joseph Shine case”), where the Court struck down as unconstitutional the offence of adultery under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”), also applied to individuals in the armed forces. Factual Background:  The Union of India sought a clarification on whether the judgment of the Supreme Court in the 2018 Joseph Shine case applied to the members of the armed forces who are governed by the Army Act, 1950, Air Force Act, 1950 and Navy Act, 1957. These three Acts had provisions punishing individuals in the armed forces for violations of discipline. Such violations included, among others, promiscuous or adulterous acts. Since the 2018 Joseph Shine case declared adultery under Section 497 of IPC as unconstitutional, the Union of India filed a petition to clarify whether the judgment in that case would also apply to the armed forces who are governed under these special laws and whether the judgment would affect proceedings concerning allegedly adulterous acts punishable under the Army Act, Air Force Act and Navy Act.In the 2018 Joseph Shine case, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that Section 497 of the IPC was unconstitutional as it offended Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India and unreasonably discriminated between a man and a woman. Section 497 of the IPC defined adultery on the basis that if a person (a man) had consensual sexual intercourse with the wife of another man, without the consent of that man, then such person would be liable for having committed adultery. However, the wife could not be punished in such cases. The Court in the same case also struck down Section 198(2) of the Criminal Code of Procedure (“CrPC”) as it treated only the husband of a woman who committed adultery as an aggrieved person who could file a complaint, and did not extend the same treatment to the wife of a man who had engaged in adultery. The Court held that this statutory provision reflected an antiquated approach where wives were considered the “property” of men.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court unanimously held that its decision in the 2018 Joseph Shine case did not consider whether the invalidation of Section 497 of the IPC applied to the Army Act, Air Force Act or Navy Act that governed the armed forces. Thus, the striking down of adultery under the IPC did not affect proceedings against members of the armed forces under the Army Act, Air Force Act or Navy Act. Justice Joseph authored the judgment of the Court.Reasons for the Decision:  Article 33 of the Constitution states that Parliament has the power to enact a law to modify the applicability of Fundamental Rights to the armed forces. The Union of India submitted that the armed forces were a distinct class and thus, the judgment of the Supreme Court in the 2018 Joseph Shine case would not apply to them since the Army Act, Air Force Act and Navy Act were separate codes which operated independently of the IPC (¶11). The Union of India submitted that where a member of the armed forces was charged with unbecoming conduct and it consisted of adultery, then the judgment in the 2018 Joseph Shine case should not prevent authorities in the armed forces from taking action against such member (¶¶11-12).The Supreme Court held that its judgment in the 2018 Joseph Shine case was only concerned with the constitutional validity of Section 497 of the IPC and 198(2) of the CrPC (¶23). In that case the Court did not consider the validity of the provisions in the Army Act, Air Force Act or Navy Act punishing adultery (¶23). Therefore, the Court held that the judgment in the 2018 Joseph Shine case had no effect on the operation of proceedings against members of the armed forces under the Army Act, Air Force Act or Navy Act (¶24).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

SHOURIE vs UNION OF INDIA (A) MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE SECRETARYMA 1699/2019 in W.P.(C) No. 215/2005,Revisions to guidelines on euthanasia and execution of 'Advanced Medical Directives'.,"COMMON CAUSE (A REGD. SOCIETY) DIRECTOR SH. H.D. SHOURIE V. UNION OF INDIA (A) MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE SECRETARY2023 INSC 77 (24 January 2023)Justices:  Justice KuttiyilM. Joseph, Justice Ajay Rastogi, Justice Aniruddha Bose, Justice Hrishikesh Roy,  Justice Chudalayil T. RavikumarQuestion(s):  Do the euthanasia guidelines issued by the Supreme Court for terminally ill patients in Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v Union of India need to be modified?Factual Background:  On 9 March 2018, a Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court, in Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v Union of India, (“Common Cause”) upheld the right to die with dignity, and gave legal recognition to an ‘Advance Medical Directive’ (“AMD”) or a ‘living will’. An AMD allows individuals to outline their wishes regarding the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in the event they become terminally ill or are in a persistent vegetative state and are unable to communicate their desires, thereby allowing them to end their prolonged suffering.The Court laid down guidelines for creating an AMD, including who can execute an advance directive, what it should contain, how it should be recorded and preserved, and when and by whom can it be given effect. It was clarified by the Court that the guidelines shall remain in force till the Parliament brings a legislation in the field.Subsequently, the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine filed an application seeking certain modifications and clarifications of some of the guidelines in the Common Cause judgment. They argued that many obstacles were faced in the implementation of the Court’s guidelines. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) modified the Common Cause judgment dated 9 March 2018, and simplified the procedure for executing AMDs, such as significantly reducing the role of Judicial Magistrate First Class. The objective was to streamline the process to address practical challenges encountered during the implementation of the directives. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Joseph.Reasons for the Decision:  Reduced role of Judicial Magistrate First Class (“JMFC”)The Supreme Court reduced the involvement of JMFCs, recognizing the difficulties an ordinary individual may face in accessing a judicial magistrate. Previously, the guideline mandated that the AMD had to be signed by two attesting witnesses and countersigned by a JMFC. However, the Court revised this requirement, eliminating the role of a JMFC. Now, the AMD can be signed in the presence of two attesting witnesses, and before a notary or a Gazetted Officer, who can confirm that the document was executed voluntarily.Additionally, the earlier guidelines tasked the JMFC with informing the family members of the executor about the AMD’s execution. This guideline has been modified, placing the responsibility on the executor to inform their family members and family physician, and provide them with a copy of the AMD.Previously, when the treating physician was informed about the AMD, they were required to verify its genuineness from a JMFC. Now, the genuineness must be verified from existing digital health records or the custodian of the document.The Supreme Court also deleted certain guidelines pertaining to the role of a JMFC, such as the JMFC’s duty to preserve a copy of the advance directive in his office, to forward it to the Registry of the jurisdictional District Court for being preserved, and the JMFC’s duty to hand over a copy of the AMD to the family physician.Constitution of the Medical BoardThe earlier guidelines required the treating physician to determine if the AMD is genuine and if there is any hope of the patient being cured, before they suggest withdrawing treatment. The hospital must then form a Medical Board comprising the head of the treatment department and at least three experts with over twenty years of experience in general medicine, cardiology, nephrology, neurology, oncology or psychiatry, with an added experience in critical care.If the Medical Board certifies that the instructions in the AMD should be carried out, the District Collector is charged with creating a second Medical Board which will include the Chief Medical Officer of the district. The same experience requirements will apply to the three new doctors selected for the second medical board. After visiting the patient, this medical board will decide if they agree with the decision of the hospital’s medical board.Recognizing the challenge of finding doctors with over twenty years of experience in many regions of the country, the Supreme Court eased the qualification requirement for board members. The guidelines were modified to stipulate that doctors now only need a minimum of five years of experience to serve on the renamed ‘Primary’ and ‘Secondary’ medical boards. The Secondary board will no longer include the Chief Medical Officer. Instead, the Chief Medical Officer will nominate a registered medical practitioner. The minimum number of board members for both boards has been reduced to three. Further, the Court placed a time limit of forty eight hours on each medical board to arrive at a decision.Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

No. 113/2016,Extent to which private (non-State) parties are required to respect the Article 19 and 21 rights of other persons.,"KAUSHAL KISHOR V. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH GOVT. OF U.P. HOME SECRETARY2023 INSC 4 (3 January 2023)Justices:  Justice Syed A. Nazeer, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice V. Ramasubramanian, Justice B. V. NagarathnaQuestion(s):  (i) Are the grounds enumerated in Article 19(2) of the Constitution the only reasons for which free speech can be restricted under the Constitution? (ii) Can fundamental rights under Articles 19 or 21 of the Constitution be enforced against non-State actors (e.g., other citizens or private companies)? (iii) Is the State duty-bound to protect the Article 21 right of a citizen, when infringed by non-State actors? (iv) Can a statement made by a Minister about State affairs be attributed to the Government? (v) Can a statement by a Minister, inconsistent with the fundamental rights of a citizen, be held to violate a citizen’s rights? Factual Background:  On 29 July 2016, a woman and her minor daughter were allegedly gangraped on National Highway 91. The victims petitioned the Supreme Court, seeking transfer of the trial to Delhi from Uttar Pradesh, in the hope of a fair investigation. The victims also sought action against Mr. Azam Khan, Minister for Urban Development in the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet, who had labelled the incident an “opposition conspiracy” hatched to defame the State Government. On 5 October 2017, a Three-Judge Bench referred the questions arising for consideration in this petition to a Constitution Bench (five judges).On 10 November 2017, the Three-Judge Bench clubbed the petition with an appeal from Kerala that raised similar issues. The appeal challenged the inaction of the Government of Kerala in addressing derogatory statements about women made by its Minister for Electricity, Mr. M. M. Mani.On 24 October 2019, the Constitution Bench framed the above-mentioned five questions for consideration. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court found that the grounds enumerated in Article 19(2) for restricting the right to free speech were exhaustive, and that free speech cannot be restricted for reasons not found in Article 19(2). The Court held that Articles 19 and 21 could be enforced against non-State actors (e.g., other citizens or private companies). It also found that the State has an affirmative duty to protect a person’s rights under Article 21, even against non-State actors.The Court held that a statement made by a Minister about State affairs, could not be attributed to the Government. It also held that a mere statement by a Minister which undermined the fundamental rights of a person or citizen would not be actionable unless it led to an act or omission of public officers that caused harm or loss to the person or citizen. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Ramasubramanian. Justice Nagarathna wrote a separate opinion which dissented on certain issues.The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court directed that the petition from Uttar Pradesh and the appeal from Kerala be listed before regular benches of the Court to be decided in accordance with the principles laid down by the Constitution Bench. Reasons for the Decision:  Exhaustive nature of Article 19(2)The Supreme Court found that the eight grounds to impose “reasonable restrictions” on free speech were comprehensive and exhaustive ((¶¶28, 32). They anticipated all possible attacks on individuals, classes of people, society, the State, the Court and the country— the subjects whom the Article sought to protect (¶32, J. Ramasubramanian, ¶35, J. Nagarathna). Free speech could not be restricted for any additional reasons, including by invoking other fundamental rights (¶45, J. Ramasubramanian, ¶35, J. Nagarathna). Where two fundamental rights staked rival claims, they were to be balanced using established tools of judicial interpretation (¶¶44-45).Enforceability of Fundamental Rights against non-State actorsThe Supreme Court found that some fundamental rights were enforceable against non-State actors (¶75). The Court acknowledged that although it had been wary of extending the enforcement of fundamental rights to private individuals, its approach had evolved over time (¶76). Rights once exclusively enforced against the State, were gradually enforced against private individuals with regard to the public duties or functions they performed (¶77-78). Hence, the Court held that Articles 19 and 21 could be enforced against parties other than the State and its instrumentalities (¶78). It observed that initially, only the State was thought capable of lawfully depriving a person’s life and personal liberty (¶82). However, over time, violations of Article 21 by non-State actors had become possible. First, this was because Article 21 had been interpreted to include a host of associated rights to protect a person’s dignity (such as the right to livelihood and environment), and second, traditional Government functions had been outsourced to private actors and public-private partnerships (¶84).Justice Nagarathna disagreed. In her partly dissenting opinion, she held that fundamental rights under Articles 19 and 21 could not be enforced against private actors, unless they had been recognised in statute or common law (¶43, J. Nagarathna). Enforcing fundamental rights against non-State actors would ignore the difference between a fundamental right and a common law right (¶43, J. Nagarathna). However, a writ of habeas corpus could be sought against a private person for an Article 21 violation, since illegal detention, whether effected by the State or a private party, had an identical effect on the life and liberty of the detainee (¶43, J. Nagarathna).Government not responsible for individual Minister's statementsThe Petitioners argued that Ministers making wayward statements should be subject to disciplinary action. However, the Supreme Court stated that a ‘Code of Conduct for Ministers’ could not be enforced in a court of law (¶127), and that the Prime Minister or Chief Minister did not have disciplinary control over the Council of Ministers (¶128).The Supreme Court concluded that a statement made by a Minister about State affairs, or to protect the Government, could not be ascribed to the Government by invoking the principle of collective responsibility (¶137). It observed that the principle of collective responsibility envisioned in Articles 75(3) and 164(2) of the Constitution required the Council of Ministers to be responsible to the legislature, not the Chief Minister or Prime Minister (¶126). Even though each individual Minister is responsible for the decisions taken collectively by the Council of Ministers, the statements of individual Ministers made outside the legislature could not be attributed to the Council of Ministers (¶135).On the contrary, Justice Nagarathna (in her partly dissenting opinion) held that a statement by a Minister, made in an official capacity, could be attributed to the Government if it were representative of the views of the Government itself (¶45, J. Nagarathna).Requirements for a constitutional tortThe Supreme Court found that the Government could not be held responsible for a mere statement by a Minister which undermined a citizen’s or person’s constitutional rights. It could only be held responsible if, as a consequence of that statement, public officers did or failed to do something which caused harm or loss to the citizen or person (¶154).Justice Nagarathna identified the need for a proper framework to determine the acts and omissions of Government agents which would constitute a constitutional tort. She noted that the Government would not be held responsible if the statements of its agents caused harm or loss to a citizen or person, unless the views expressed in the statements aligned with its own (¶66, J. Nagarathna).Prepared by Avanti DivanCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

28,02-01-2023,VIVEK NARAYAN SHARMA vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 906/2016,Constitutional challenge to 'Demonetisation'.,"VIVEK NARAYAN SHARMA V. UNION OF INDIA2023 INSC 2 (2 January 2023)Justices:  Justice Syed A. Nazeer, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice V. Ramasubramanian, Justice B. V. NagarathnaQuestion(s):  Whether ‘demonetisation’ (i.e., that ?500 and ?1,000 notes will not be legal tender) was legal and constitutional. The Supreme Court framed 5 issues:Whether (i) the Union Government’s power under Section 26(2) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (“RBI Act”) to declare invalid “any series” of bank notes meant the Union Government could declare invalid all series of bank notes of a particular denomination (?500 and ?1,000); and (ii) if the Union Government could remove all series of a particular denomination, whether this amounted to excessive delegation of power to the Union Government.Whether the Notification dated 8 November 2016 (“Demonetisation Notification”) should be struck down because it was based on a legally flawed decision-making process.Whether the 2016 Notification should be struck down as a disproportionate action.Whether the time period provided for exchange of notes by the 2016 Notification was reasonable.Whether the RBI has an independent power under Section 4(2) of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017 (“Bank Notes Act 2017”) to accept the demonetised notes beyond the period specified in the Notifications issued under Section 4(1) of the Bank Notes Act.Factual Background:  On 8 November 2016, the Union Government issued the Demonetisation Notification under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act, 1934. Section 26(2) of the RBI Act states that on recommendation of the Central Board of the RBI, the Union Government may declare that “any series” of bank notes of any denomination shall cease to be legal tender. The Union Government had initially requested the Central Board of the RBI to consider recommending the demonetisation of certain high-value denominations of currency notes in order to reduce fake currency notes and black money in the Indian economy. The RBI’s Central Board considered the proposal and recommended demonetisation and thereafter, the Demonetisation Notification was issued by the Union Government.The Demonetisation Notification declared that all the existing series of ?500 and ?1000 notes shall cease to be legal tender from 9 November 2016. The policy of demonetisation fixed a time period (initially up to 30 December 2016 and later extended by subsequent Notifications to 30 June 2017) for individuals to exchange their bank notes in various banks, subject to certain conditions.The Parliament of India subsequently enacted the Bank Notes Act, 2017. Section 3 of the Bank Notes Act provided that the specified bank notes that ceased to be legal tender under the Demonetisation Notification would no longer be legally guaranteed by the RBI. Section 4 of the 2017 Act provided for a grace period for certain classes of persons to return the specified bank notes to the RBI.The legal validity of the Demonetisation Notification and policy was challenged in multiple petitions before various High Courts and the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court transferred all such matters to itself and the case was referred to a Constitution Bench of the Court (five judges).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, by a majority of 4:1, held that the policy of demonetisation and the Demonetisation Notification were legally and constitutionally valid. Justice Gavai authored the majority judgment on behalf of himself and Justices Nazeer, Bopanna and Ramasubramanian. Justice Nagarathna authored a dissenting minority opinion.The Supreme Court held that the Union Government had the power under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act to declare ‘all’ series of bank notes invalid and this included the power to invalidate all series of a denomination of notes. The majority further held that interpreting the provision in this manner does not excessively delegate power to the Government as the power can only be exercised on the recommendation of the RBI’s Central Board. The majority held that the Demonetisation Notification: (i) was not based on a flawed decision making process; (ii) was proportional; and (iii) the time period for exchange of notes was reasonable.The dissenting opinion by Justice Nagarathna held that only the Central Board of the RBI could recommend demonetisation of “any” (and not “all”) series of bank notes under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act. The Union Government could elect to accept such recommendation and issue a notification under Section 26(2) to bring it into effect. In Justice Nagarathna’s view, the Union Government could only demonetise “any” or “all” series of bank notes without the recommendation of the Central Board of the RBI by passing a law in Parliament.Reasons for the Decision:  Interpreting Section 26(2) of the RBI ActThe Supreme Court held that the scope of the term “any series” used in Section 26(2) of the RBI Act had to be interpreted in light of the special nature and objectives of the RBI Act (¶¶146-147). The RBI was created with the purpose of issuing bank notes and currency on behalf of the Union Government and this power was conferred on the RBI by the Parliament of India under the RBI Act (¶149). Since Parliament itself conferred powers on the Union Government to act on recommendations of the Central Board of RBI under the RBI Act, the Court held that such powers cannot be interpreted in a restrictive manner (¶149). This meant that the term “any series” of a denomination in Section 26(2) can mean “all series” of a denomination. Thus, the Union Government, on the recommendation from the Central Board of the RBI could demonetise all series of ?500 and ?1,000 bank notes (¶¶151, 158).In her dissent, Justice Nagarathna held that Section 26(2) of the RBI Act was limited only to proposals for demonetisation initiated by the Central Board of the RBI (¶¶15.13, 15.25, J. Nagarathna). On examining the document records submitted by the Union Government and the RBI, Justice Nagarathna found that the demonetisation proposal was initiated by the Union Government and not by the Central Board of the RBI (¶17, J. Nagarathna). Since the procedure prescribed in Section 26(2) of the RBI Act was not followed, she held that the Demonetisation Notification was unlawful (¶19.5, J. Nagarathna). Moreover, considering the serious economic ramifications of such an exercise, such demonetisation must have been carried out by legislation and not by an executive action like the Demonetisation Notification (¶15.13, J. Nagarathna).Issue of excessive delegationThe Petitioners argued that if the term “any series” used in Section 26(2) of the RBI Act allowed the Union Government to demonetise all series of a denomination, this would give the Union Government unguided, arbitrary and excessive powers (¶160). The Supreme Court ruled that a mere possibility of abuse of delegated powers is not a ground to strike down a law (¶193). The Court stated that Section 26(2) of the RBI Act had an in-built safeguard since the decision to demonetise had to be taken on the recommendation of the Central Board of the RBI (¶201). Thus, the Court held that Section 26(2) did not suffer from the problem of excessive delegation (¶211).In her dissenting opinion, Justice Nagarathna stated that under Section 26(2) of the RBI Act, only the Central Board of RBI could initiate a proposal for demonetisation but it cannot do so for “all” series or “all” denominations of bank notes as that would lead to granting excessive delegated powers to the RBI (¶5, J. Nagarathna).Proportionality and reasonablenessThe Petitioners argued that the drastic measure of demonetisation, which caused hardships to citizens, could have been avoided if the Government adopted alternative measures that caused less hardship, and so, the Demonetisation Notification was disproportionate to the aim it sought to achieve (¶263). The Supreme Court held that the policy of demonetisation fulfilled the test of proportionality (¶¶271-277) as there was a direct and rationale nexus between the objectives sought to be achieved (curbing fake currency and financing of terrorism to ensure India’s economic security) and the measures taken (the demonetisation of ?500 and ?1,000 notes) (¶280).The Petitioners had also argued that the time period provided to exchange the demonetised bank notes for new ones was unreasonable (¶282). The Supreme Court held that the fifty-two days (9 November 2016 to 30 December 2016) that had been provided for the exchange of notes was not unreasonable considering the case of Jayantilal Ratanchand Shah v. Reserve Bank of India [(1996) 9 SCC 650]. In that case, the Supreme Court had upheld the demonetisation of bank notes in 1978 where only three days were provided for exchanging the demonetised notes (¶285) and noted that providing a longer period would undermine the object of demonetisation (¶286). On this basis, the Court held that the period of fifty-two days given in the 2016 Notification for exchange of demonetised notes was not unreasonable (¶288).Independent powers of RBI under 2017 ActIt was also submitted by the Petitioners that the RBI had independent powers under Section 4(2) of the Bank Notes Act to accept demonetised notes even after the period specified in the 2016 Notification, provided that the reasons for failure to deposit the notes were satisfactory (¶289). The Supreme Court, however, read Section 4(2) in the context of Sections 3 and 4(1) of the Bank Notes Act. Section 3 of the Act stated that the demonetised bank notes ceased to have the guarantee of the Union Government and were no longer liabilities of the RBI while Section 4(1) allowed for exchange of the demonetised bank notes by citizens of India as well as other classes of persons as per conditions specified by the Union Government (¶¶291-292). Thus, the Court held that the Bank Notes Act was an integrated scheme (¶299) and any exchange of the demonetised bank notes must follow the conditions specified by the Union Government and that the RBI had no independent power to accept demonetised notes (¶303).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help in a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,25-11-2024,BALRAM SINGH vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 645/2020,Constitutional validity  of the insertion of the words 'socialist' and 'secular' in the Preamble,"BALRAM SINGH V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 893 (25 November 2024)Justices:   Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay KumarQuestion(s):   Is the insertion of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble to the Constitution during the emergency period by the Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 constitutionally valid? Factual Background:   Several writ petitions were filed under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the insertion of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ by the Forty-Second Amendment Act, 1976 in the Preamble to the Constitution. The petitioners raised the grounds that the insertion of the word ‘secular’ was deliberately abstained by the Constituent Assembly and the word ‘socialist’  restricts the economic policy choice vesting in the elected government. The petitioners also argued that the insertion was faulty because it was ‘passed’ during the Emergency when there was no will of the people to sanction the amendments as the normal tenure of the Lok Sabha had ended on 18 March 1976.Decision of the Supreme Court:   A Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court dismissed the writ petitions by holding that the constitutional position regarding the secular and socialist nature of the Constitution remains unambiguous due to earlier interpretations of these words by the Supreme Court. The order of the Court was rendered by a bench of CJI Khanna and Justice Kumar.Reasons for the Decision:   Lack of justification for the challengeThe Supreme Court held that the challenge to the amendment has been made  forty-four years after its enactment, and it lacks merit because the terms ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ have been widely accepted and understood by the people of India. These additions have not restricted legislations or policies pursued by elected governments. Therefore, the Court refused to undertake a detailed  examination of the challenge (¶7). Widest connotation to the word  ‘Secularism’The Supreme Court affirmed the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, including its Preamble under Article 368. It held that the power is not limited by the date of the Constitution's adoption and the retrospective nature of the amendment would not curtail the power so conferred (¶2). The Supreme Court acknowledged that the concept of secularism has evolved. It reasoned that while the Constituent Assembly did not explicitly include the term ‘secular,’ the Constitution's provisions, such as Articles 14 (right to equality), 15 (right against discrimination), 16 (equality of opportunity), 25 (right to religious freedom), 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs), 29 (protection of interests of minorities), and 30 (right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions), reflect a secular ethos. The Supreme Court referred to R C Poudyal v. Union of India (1993 INSC 51) where it was held that secularism essentially represents the nation's commitment to treat persons of all faiths equally and without discrimination (¶4). The Court further reiterated that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution as was expounded in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973 INSC 91) and S R Bommai v. Union of India (1994 INSC 111) (¶4). Interpretation of the word ‘Socialist’The Supreme Court ruled that the term ‘socialist’ in the Indian context does not mandate a specific economic model. It signifies the State's commitment to social and economic justice, ensuring that no citizen is disadvantaged due to economic or social circumstances. The Court observed that the term does not preclude the existence of a mixed economy or private enterprise. The Court ruled  that the word ‘socialism’ reflects the goal of economic and social upliftment and does not restrict private entrepreneurship and the right to business and trade which is  a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution (¶5).The Supreme Court held that the majority judgment in the Nine-Judge Constitution Bench in Property Owners Association v. State of Maharashtra (2024 INSC 835)  removed the ambiguity regarding the model of governance by ruling  that the Constitution as framed in broad terms allows the elected government to adopt a structure for economic governance which would subserve the policies for which it is accountable to the electorate (¶6).Prepared by Priyanka Giri (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"

No. 2286/2006,Criteria for the determination of a minority educational institution.,"ALIGARH MUSLIM UNIVERSITY THROUGH ITS REGISTRAR FAIZAN MUSTAFA V. NARESH AGARWAL2024 INSC 856 (8 November 2024)Justices:   Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Surya Kant, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Dipankar Datta, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Satish C. SharmaQuestion(s):    (i) When does an educational institution qualify as a minority institution entitled to the protections under Article 30 of the Constitution? (ii) Whether the Supreme Court’s judgment in S. Azeez Basha v. Union of India (“Azeez Basha”) (1967 INSC 238), which held that Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is not a minority institution is correct.Factual Background:   Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established the Mohammadan Anglo Oriental College (MAO) on 8 January 1877 in Aligarh. In 1920, the British Imperial Legislative Council enacted the Aligarh Muslim University Act (“AMU Act”), incorporating AMU as a university. In 1950, as part of the Constitution Article 30(1) came into force which grants minorities the right  to establish and administer educational institutions. In 1967, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court (five Judges) in Azeez Basha ruled that AMU was not a minority institution because it was established by statute and thus was not ""established"" and ""administered"" by a minority community as required by Article 30(1). On 26 November 1981, a Two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya v. District Inspector of Schools (“Rahmaniya”) (W.P.(C) No. 54-57 of 1981 ) referred the correctness of  Azeez Basha to a Seven-Judge Bench. Parliament then enacted the Aligarh Muslim University (Amendment) Act, 1981 (“1981 Amendment”). This Amendment amended the AMU Act significantly and defined the “University” as an institution “established by the Muslims of India,” originating as MAO College and later incorporated as AMU, aiming to further the educational and cultural advancement of Indian Muslims.In 2005, the Allahabad High Court declared AMU’s fifty-percent reservation policy for Muslim students in its postgraduate medical program unconstitutional. In doing so, the High Court held that AMU was not a minority institution under Article 30(1) even after the 1981 Amendment. On 12 February 2019, a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, led by the Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, heard AMU’s appeal and observed that the High Court’s decision relied on Azeez Basha, the correctness of which had been questioned in Rahmaniya and not yet conclusively decided. Consequently, the Court referred the matter to a Seven-Judge Bench. Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Supreme Court by a 4-3  majority overruled Azeez Basha. The majority held that merely because an institute is created by a statute does not strip it of minority status. The majority also held that Article 30(1) protects institutes established before the Constitution came into force in 1950. The Court laid down criteria to determine when an institution is a minority institution benefitting from Article 30(1) protection. The majority judgment was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud. Justices  Kant, Datta and Sharma authored separate (partly dissenting) opinions. Reasons for the Decision:   The reference in Rahmaniya is not bad in lawThe majority upheld the decision of the Two-Judge Bench in Rahmaniya which questioned the correctness of Azeez Basha and requested that the matter be placed before the Chief Justice for consideration by a Seven-Judge Bench. The majority further clarified that the Chief Justice retains discretionary administrative authority to assign cases to any Bench of any strength irrespective of whether they are part of the bench referring the issue to a larger bench (¶¶36–39 CJ. Chandrachud).Justices Kant, Datta, and Sharma in their dissenting opinions held that the manner of referral to a larger bench in Rahmaniya was legally flawed and breached established norms of judicial propriety (¶91 J. Kant, ¶¶24-25 J. Datta, ¶266 J. Sharma). Justice Kant noted that the Division Bench (two judges) in Rahmaniya, being of lesser strength than the Constitution Bench (five judges) in Azeez Basha, lacked the authority to explicitly question the correctness of  Azeez Basha or suggest the strength of the bench which should resolve the alleged conflict (¶¶93-94 J. Kant). He held that a direction specifying the strength of the bench to which a case should be referred to impaired the Chief Justice of India’s authority as the master of the roster (¶94 J. Kant). Justice Datta observed that the issue should have first been placed before a Three-Judge Bench (¶28 J. Datta). He further  held that Rahmaniya was concerned with the registration of a minority institution under the Societies Registration Act, while Azeez Basha addressed the incorporation of a university by statute. Thus, referring Azeez Basha to a seven-judge bench was unwarranted, even on merits (¶42 J. Datta).Minority status is not lost merely because an institute is created by a statuteThe majority held that the right to establish and administer educational institutions under Article 30(1) extends to institutions established both before and after the Constitution’s adoption (¶¶81–83 CJ. Chandrachud, ¶¶67 J. Datta, ¶¶107-108 J. Kant). The majority held that an educational institution does not lose its minority status merely because it is created by a statute (¶98 CJ. Chandrachud, ¶¶151-155,190 J.Kant). The majority clarified the distinction between ""incorporation"" and ""establishment,"" noting that incorporation gives legal existence to an institution, while establishment refers to its founding. The majority emphasised that the status of a minority institution depends on the individuals or group behind its creation, not the legal process through which it was incorporated (¶¶93-94 CJ. Chandrachud). The majority stressed that the examination of its founding should be based on the situation at the time of the Constitution’s adoption, not before independence (¶¶112, 122 CJ. Chandrachud).Justice Kant in his separate opinion also held that if an institution possesses legal existence independent of the statute, then the statute merely recognises an existing institution and does not establish it and therefore it cannot take away the role of the minority community in bringing the institution into existence (¶155 J. Kant). However, the legislative intent behind the establishment of an institution plays a significant role in determining the character of that institution (¶190 J. Kant, ¶ 266 J. Sharma). Azeez Basha does not lay down the correct lawThe majority held that Azeez Basha incorrectly relied on The Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali (“Dargah Committee”) (1961 INSC 101) to support the view that a minority’s right to administer an institution could be forfeited under certain circumstances. It found that Durgah Committee was concerned with the the right of religious denominations to own and administer property under Article 26. The majority ruled that no parallel could be drawn between the rights under Article 26 and Article 30(1), as the scope and nature of the rights under these provisions are different (¶¶73, 78, 79 CJ. Chandrachud).Justice Kant in his separate dissenting opinion held that Azeez Basha needed to be clarified because it holds that before 1956, university degrees did not need to be recognised by the government, while also holding that it was only the AMU Act which allowed AMU to confer degrees. This led it to conclude that AMU was brought into existence by an act of legislation (¶190 J.Kant).Justice Sharma in his separate dissenting opinion held that Azeez Basha does not categorically prohibit minorities from establishing universities through statutes because the case dealt with a unique situation where a university established by the British Legislative Council had claimed minority status (¶¶188-190 J. Sharma). Criteria for the ‘establishment’ of a minority educational institutionThe majority held that an institution’s minority status does not require it to exclusively serve the minority community. It must predominantly benefit the minority, and courts must examine the origin of the institution, such as who sought its establishment, the purpose for which it was founded, and the steps taken to implement its creation. This includes factors like funding, land acquisition, and construction, all of which should primarily involve the minority community (¶¶134-136 CJ. Chandrachud). The majority held that it is not necessary to prove that the administration of the university vests with the minority community to prove that it is a minority educational institution. This is because the very purpose of Article 30(1) is to grant special additional rights regarding administration as a consequence of establishment. The majority ruled that while it is not necessary for minority members to manage the institution, the administration should still affirm the institution's minority purpose (¶¶138-139 CJ. Chandrachud). It also ruled that the status of an institution as one of national importance does not negate its minority character, as the terms ""national"" and ""minority"" are not mutually exclusive (¶148 CJ. Chandrachud).Justices Kant, Datta, and Sharma agreed with the criteria set out by  the majority but made certain additional observations.  According to Justices Kant and Sharma, legal and factual control over the university’s administration must vest with the minority community to benefit from the protections under Article 30 (¶¶184-186 J. Kant, ¶¶167-169 J. Sharma). Justice Sharma also observed that the minority community must prove that the institution was brought about due to the efforts of the minority community (¶169 J. Sharma). Justice Datta cautioned that a rigid, one-size-fits-all framework would be unsuitable for accurately assessing minority institution status (¶¶54, 57 J. Datta). AMU’s minority status is to be decided by another benchThe majority held that the core issue in Rahmaniya was regarding the essential ingredients of a minority education institution. The 2019 reference order was also limited to the criteria to qualify as a minority educational institution (¶¶33-35 CJ. Chandrachud). Thus, having laid out these criteria the majority, along with Justices Kant and Sharma, held that the issue of whether AMU was a minority institution should be decided by a regular bench (¶¶35,161 CJ. Chandrachud, ¶188 J.Kant, ¶¶ 126, 218 J.Sharma).However, Justice Datta in his dissenting opinion, held that sending AMU's minority status to a regular bench was unnecessary, as the issue had been extensively argued, and resolving it would save judicial time (¶50 J.Datta). Despite finding the reference legally invalid, he chose to answer the reference and affirmed the conclusion in Azeez Basha that AMU was established by the imperial legislature through the AMU Act, not by the Muslim community (¶¶87-88 J. Datta). Justice Datta observed that the societies linked to AMU’s claimed minority heritage dissolved with the enactment of the AMU Act (¶77 J. Datta). He further ruled that the governance structure, funding, admissions, and appointments in the University demonstrates an involvement of the State which amounted to absolute control over the administration of the University (¶101 J. Datta). He emphasised that the AMU Act’s preamble lacked any recognition of minority contributions (¶72 J. Datta). Prepared by Osama Noor and Raza ZaidiCentre for Research and Planning |  Supreme Court of India"

No. 9486-9487/2019,Validity of unilateral appointment of arbitrators in public-private contract,"CENTRAL ORGANISATION FOR RAILWAY ELECTRIFICATION V. M/S ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A JOINT VENTURE COMPANY2024 INSC 857 (8 November 2024)Justices:   Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Pamidighantam S. Narasimha, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra Question(s):   (i) Whether a person ineligible to be an arbitrator under the seventh schedule of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Arbitration Act”) can mandate the other party choose an arbitrator from the panel of arbitrators curated by them. (ii) Whether the principle of equal treatment of parties applies when appointing arbitrators. (iii) Whether the unilateral appointment of arbitrators by the government entity in a public-private contract violates Article 14 of the Constitution.Factual Background:   Section 12(5) of the Arbitration Act disqualifies persons specified in the seventh schedule of the Act from being appointed arbitrators because their relationship with the parties could interfere with the tribunal’s impartiality. A Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd v. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd 2017 INSC 577 (“TRF”) and a Division Bench (two judges) of the Court in Perkins Eastman Architects DPC v. HSCC (India) Ltd (2019 INSC 1285) (“Perkins”) held that a person who is themselves ineligible to be an arbitrator, owing to their interest in the outcome of the dispute, cannot be given the authority to appoint an arbitrator in the dispute.However, in Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. M/s ECI SPIC SMO MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company (2019 INSC 1394) (“CORE”) the Supreme Court upheld an arbitral clause allowing the railways to maintain a panel of arbitrators from which private parties had to choose from. Further, the General Manager of the Railways, who is disqualified from being an arbitrator under the seventh schedule, would then appoint at least one arbitrator. In 2021, another three-judge bench of the Supreme Court in Union of India v. Tantia Constructions (2021 SCC OnLine SC 271) disagreed with the reasoning in the CORE decision on the ground that if the appointing authority itself is disqualified, the resulting appointments made by them could not be held to be valid. The issue was therefore referred to a Constitution Bench (five judges).Decision of the Supreme Court:   The Constitution bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court by a 3:2 majority held that clauses in arbitration agreements allowing one party to appoint sole arbitrators unilaterally are impermissible. While public sector undertakings (“PSU”)are not prohibited from empanelling potential arbitrators, requiring the other party to select from the curated panel violated the principle of equality of parties. The Court held that the equal treatment of parties applies at all stages of arbitration, including the appointment of arbitrators. The majority opinion was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud on behalf of himself and Justices Misra and Pardiwala. Justice Roy and Justice Narasimha wrote separate partially dissenting opinions. Justice Roy held that unilateral appointments are not inherently invalid, as long as they do not fall within those prohibited by the Seventh Schedule. Justice Narasimha held that courts should determine whether a specific unilateral appointment of an arbitrator warrants prohibition.Reasons for the Decision:   The principles of equality of parties and independence and impartialityThe majority held that the principle of party autonomy in arbitration was regulated by the mandatory provisions of the Arbitration Act (¶32 CJ. Chandrachud). Section 12 and Section 18 are the provisions ensuring the independence and impartiality of the arbitrators and the equality of parties and therefore should be applied in all circumstances to any arbitration agreement (¶55 CJ. Chandrachud, ¶2 J. Roy). These provisions ensure procedural equality within arbitral proceedings, which is required of all quasi-judicial bodies under Article 14 of the Constitution (¶¶72-73 CJ. Chandrachud). Therefore, the principle of equality of parties as enshrined under Section 18 applies to the arbitration proceedings at all stages including the appointment of arbitrators (¶75 Chandrachud). The majority held that the unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator would hinder the equal participation of both parties by depriving the parties of equality of opportunity to represent themselves in the proceedings (¶129 CJ. Chandrachud). The majority also held that in case of appointment of a three-member panel, mandating the other party to select an arbitrator exclusively from its curated panel was against the principle of equal treatment of parties as it restricted the freedom of the other party to appoint an arbitrator of their choice and there remained no effective counter-balance because both parties did not participate equally in the process of appointing arbitrators (¶¶131-133 CJ. Chandrachud).Justice Roy held that Sections 11 and 12 of the Arbitration Act restricted courts from intervening at the stage of appointment of arbitrators (¶22 J. Roy). He further held that a blanket prohibition of unilateral appointments of arbitrators was unnecessary as the arbitration process already provided for multiple safeguards in case of apprehensions of bias under provisions such as Sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 which consisted of remedies such as rendering an arbitrator ineligible and allowing challenges to their appointment (¶¶39-42 J. Roy, ¶54.4 J. Narasimha). Justice Narasimha held that because Section 18 was included in the chapter of the Arbitration Act following the one governing appointments, it cannot be applied at the time of appointment. He observed that the obligation to ensure impartiality and independence was on the arbitral tribunal and not on the parties (¶54.3 J. Narasimha).Arbitration proceedings are governed by principles of natural justiceThe majority held that the unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator was impermissible as it would result in a real possibility of bias by giving rise to ‘justifiable doubts regarding their independence or impartiality.’ Parties may have an understandable apprehension that such an arbitrator may be unduly influenced by the appointing party (¶128 J. Chandrachud). Similarly, a PSU choosing only empanelling a certain number of persons as potential arbitrators will cause a reasonable person to think that it might have nominated them because they favour the PSU (¶135 J. Chandrachud).Justice Roy and Justice Narasimha held that the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator cannot be governed by broader principles of administrative law, and must exclusively be examined within the statutory framework of the Arbitration Act and the Contract Act (¶¶3-4 J. Roy, ¶¶54.2 J. Narasimha). Public-private contracts must be consistent with public policyIn contracts between the state and private parties, the majority ruled that the state was required to act fairly under Article 14 of the Constitution. Section 34 of the Arbitration Act expressly imposed an obligation to abide by public policy principles by providing for the setting aside of the arbitral award if it violated the public policy of India (¶¶157-158 J. Chandrachud). In arbitration agreements involving the state, the unilateral appointment of a sole arbitrator by the state contravened the public policy of the country (¶163 J. Chandrachud).Prepared by Abhishek Rath (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"
4,07-11-2024,TEJ PRAKASH PATHAK vs RAJASTHAN HIGH COURTC.A. No. 2634/2013,Challenge to the change in the 'rules of game' in recruitment process,"TEJ PRAKASH PATHAK V. RAJASTHAN HIGH COURT2024 INSC 847 (7 November 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Pamidighantam S. Narasimha, Justice Pankaj Mithal, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Whether the “rules of the game” governing a recruitment process can be changed after the recruitment process has commenced.Factual Background:  By its notification dated 17 September 2009, the Rajasthan High Court invited applications for the  posts of Translators. The relevant Rules specified the qualifications as well as the method of recruitment to the posts which included an examination consisting of a written test followed by an interview. After the examination, the Chief Justice of the High Court added a minimum percentage of 75% in the examination for filling up the posts in question. Some unsuccessful candidates filed a writ petition before the High Court contending that the Chief Justice’s decision amounted to “changing the rules of the game after the game is played.” After the dismissal of the writ petition by the High Court, a Special Leave Petition was filed before a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court. Doubting the correctness of the Court’s previous decision in K. Manjusree v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2008 INSC 195) (“K. Manjusree”), the case was referred  to a Constitution Bench (five judges) for an authoritative pronouncement on the question. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court unanimously held that the existing Rules governing eligibility criteria cannot be changed once recruitment begins unless the existing Rules permit it. However, recruitment bodies can devise appropriate procedures or methods of selection during the recruitment process as long as they are transparent, non-discriminatory, and rational. The Court upheld the decision in K. Manjusree. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Misra.Reasons for the Decision:  ‘Rules of the Game’ should not be changed during the gameThe Supreme Court held that the process of recruitment begins with the issuance of advertisement and ends with the filling up of notified vacancies (¶13). The Court held that the doctrine which stops the change of rules midway through the recruitment process is founded on the rule against arbitrariness in Articles 14 and 16, and the doctrine of legitimate expectations. The Court reasoned that these provisions require the State to act in a fair, transparent and non-arbitrary manner. Candidates have a legitimate expectation that selection will be based on known criteria and public authorities should act predictably unless there is a good reason not to do so (¶¶ 14-16). Procedure prescribed in the existing rules not to be violatedThe Supreme Court ruled that the principle that the rules of the game could not be changed midway  did not apply with as much strictness to the procedure for selection as it did to the fixing of the eligibility criteria. The Court held that recruiting bodies could devise appropriate procedures to conclude the recruitment process provided the procedures did not violate existing rules and were  non-discriminatory, non-arbitrary and had a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved (¶36).The Supreme Court reasoned that where the relevant Rules were silent on the procedure of selection, the recruiting body could fill in the gaps through administrative instructions provided they did not violate the provisions of the Rules, the Statute, or the Constitution. But where the Rules covered the field, the recruiting body had to abide by them (¶39). K. Manjusree is not at variance with earlier precedentsThe Supreme Court observed that in  K. Manjusree, the existing rules had not specified the procedure of selection. Thus, the concerned authority came up with an aggregate qualifying percentage for the written exam and interview. The rule was then changed following the completion of the interview process, adding a minimum qualifying percentage for the interview in itself (¶18). In these circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the change was illegal as the considerations of examiners in evaluating the candidates would have been different had they known that there was a minimum percentage for the interview in addition to the written exam (¶19).The Supreme Court addressed the contention that the decision in K. Manjusree contradicted  State of Haryana v. Subash Chander Marwaha (1973 INSC 110) (“Marwaha”)(¶22). In Marwaha, following the preparation of the selection list, the recruiting body fixed a percentage for the appointment from amongst the names in the list (¶24). This was upheld, with the Supreme Court ruling that such an act came under the purview of administrative policy (¶25). In the present case, the  Court held that Marwaha dealt with the right to be appointed from the select list whereas K. Manjusree dealt with the right to be placed in the select list. Therefore, it ruled that K. Manjusree could not be at variance with Marwaha, as both the decisions dealt with separate questions (¶26).Appointment may be denied even after placement in select listThe Supreme Court held that a candidate placed in the select list has no indefeasible right to be appointed to the post in question even if vacancies were available (¶40). It reasoned that the State was under no legal duty to fill all the vacancies if there existed good faith reasons not to do so (¶41).Prepared by Abhishek Rath (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"
5,06-11-2024,M/S. BAJAJ ALLIANCE GENERAL INSURANCE CO.LTD. vs RAMBHA DEVIC.A. No. 841/2018,"Whether an LMV Licence Holder is legally competent to drive Transport Vehicles weighing less than 7,500 kgs.","M/S. BAJAJ ALLIANCE GENERAL INSURANCE CO.LTD. V. RAMBHA DEVI2024 INSC 840 (6 November 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Pamidighantam S. Narasimha, Justice Pankaj Mittal,  Justice Manoj Misra.Question(s):  Whether a person holding a license for a “Light Motor Vehicle” (“LMV”) can drive a “Transport Vehicle” weighing less than 7,500 kgs without a specific endorsement on their license.Factual Background:  The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 (MV Act) initially categorised vehicles as light, medium, and heavy motor vehicles with light vehicles weighing less than 7,500 kgs. Subsequently, in 1994, a separate class of ‘Transport Vehicles’ (vehicles to transport passengers and goods) replaced medium and heavy motor vehicles. A question arose as to whether a person holding an LMV license could drive a Transport Vehicle weighing less than 7,500 kgs. Insurance companies regularly disputed claims by persons holding an LMV license driving a ‘Transport Vehicle’ weighing less than 7,500 kgs.In 2017, a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Mukund Dewangan v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited (2017 INSC 576) (“Mukund Dewangan”) held that a person holding an LMV driving license could drive a Transport Vehicle weighing less than 7,500 kgs. However, several insurance companies challenged the law laid down in Mukund Dewangan, arguing that inadequately trained drivers would start driving the transport vehicles.In 2018, a Division Bench (two judges) noted that the judges in Mukund Dewangan had not considered some important provisions of the MV Act, which created additional requirements for driving Transport Vehicles, and referred the matter to a larger bench for reconsideration. Subsequently, a Three-Judge Bench in 2023 also questioned the correctness of Mukund Dewangan. Hence, the matter was placed before a Constitution Bench (five judges).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench (five judges) unanimously upheld the correctness of the law laid down in Mukund Dewangan and decided that a person holding an LMV license was entitled to drive a transport vehicle weighing less than 7,500 kgs without any additional endorsement on their license. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Roy.Reasons for the Decision:  Harmonious InterpretationSection 2(21) of the MV  Act defines an LMV as a transport vehicle weighing less than 7,500 kgs while the expression ‘transport vehicle’ under Section 2(47) of the MV Act can be logically inferred to mean motor vehicles exceeding 7,500 kgs in weight (¶35, 42). The Supreme Court noted that if an LMV license holder could not drive a transport vehicle weighing less than 7,500 kgs, an LMV license would be unable to use their vehicle for small-scale commercial activities without obtaining a separate endorsement license for ‘transport vehicle’. Thus, requiring a separate license for transport vehicles weighing less than 7,500 kgs was unreasonable and contrary to the legislative intent (¶44.3). Hence, the adoption of a harmonious approach to remove the ambiguity in the application of the law was necessary (¶66).The Supreme Court observed that there is an overlap between the meaning of LMV and transport vehicle (¶70). While all transport vehicles are not LMVs, some transport vehicles may fall within the LMV class. If a transport vehicle falls within the meaning of LMV under Section 2(21) (i.e., weighs less than 7,500 kgs), then the additional requirement of a separate endorsement of the transport vehicle is not necessary (¶70). The Supreme Court also observed that the legislative intent behind the 1994 amendment to the MV Act which replaced ‘medium goods vehicle’ and ‘heavy goods vehicle’ category with ‘transport vehicle’ under Section 10(2)(e) to 10(2)(h) was to simplify the licensing procedure and therefore the term ‘Transport Vehicle’ in the licensing scheme has to be understood only in the context of the ‘medium’ and ‘heavy’ vehicles (¶127). Interpretation must not result in impractical outcomesThe Supreme Court underscored that a statute should be interpreted to avoid any impractical outcomes (¶77). To obtain an endorsement of a transport vehicle, a person has to be tested on a transport vehicle with no distinction between heavy, medium or light category. This would mean that a person seeking an endorsement for a transport vehicle of LMV class such as an auto-rickshaw would have to undergo extensive level of training recommended under Rule 31 of the MV Rules for the transport vehicle. To apply this extensive training for the auto driver would defy logic and certainly lead to an impractical outcome (¶¶79-81). Therefore, it is more logical that the additional testing requirements for ‘transport vehicle’ only apply to LMVs (¶81).Lack of empirical data suggestive of adverse impact on road safetyThe Supreme Court observed that safe driving requires thorough knowledge of traffic rules and a focus on the road free from distractions which is true for all drivers irrespective of the class of vehicle they drive (¶123). The Supreme Court noted that no empirical data suggested that an increase in the number of road accidents in India was a direct result of drivers with LMV licenses driving a transport vehicle weighing less than 7,500 kgs and arguments suggesting an increase in the number of accidents as a direct result of Mukund Dewangan remained unsubstantiated (¶117). Prepared by Raza Zaidi Centre for Research and Planning | Supreme Court of India"
6,05-11-2024,ANJUM KADARI vs UNION OF INDIASLP(C) No. 8541/2024,"Challenge to the constitutional validity of the  Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004","ANJUM KADARI V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 831 (5 November 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Whether the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004 (“Madarsa Act"") is constitutional?Factual Background:  The Madarsa Act established a ‘Board of Madarsa Education’ to regulate standards of education for students studying in Madarsas in the state. There are over 13,000 Madaras in Uttar Pradesh with over 12,00,000 students. These institutions provide both religious and secular education up to various levels including elementary, secondary, and higher education.On 22 March 2024, a Division Bench (two-judges) of the Allahabad High Court invalidated the entire Madarsa Act. The High Court held that the Madarsa Act violated the principle of secularism and Articles 14 (equality), 21 (life and liberty) and 21-A (education) of the Constitution and contravened Section 22 (right to confer degrees) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956 (“UGC Act”).It also directed the State Government to take steps to accommodate all students studying in Madrasas in schools recognised by the Education Boards of the State of Uttar Pradesh. Several Special Leave Petitions were filed against the judgment of the High Court. On 5 April 2024, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the judgment while it heard the case. Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court and upheld the constitutional validity of the Madarsa Act except the provisions which provided for the regulation of higher education degrees. These provisions were found to conflict with the UGC Act. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Madarasa Act and secularismThe Supreme Court held that a statute cannot be invalidated for violating the principles that constitute the basic structure of the Constitution (such as secularism). A law can be struck down only for violating a specific provision of the Constitution or for being enacted by a legislature that was not empowered to enact the law in question. The Court ruled that concepts such as democracy, federalism, and secularism are undefined concepts and allowing courts to strike down legislation for violation of such concepts will lead to uncertainty (¶55).The Supreme Court distinguished between “religious instruction” (teaching religious practices) and “religious education” (teaching the philosophy of religion). The Court found that Article 28 of the Constitution, which prevents imparting religious instruction at institutions maintained out of government funds, does not prohibit institutions from providing religious education nor does it prevent the government from recognising institutions imparting religious instruction alongside secular education (¶43).The Supreme Court also held that the Madarsa Act furthers substantive equality for minority institutions (¶¶70,72). It held that secularism requires the State to take active steps to help minority institutions achieve high educational standards while allowing them to retain their minority character. The Court ruled that the Madarsa Act is consistent with the positive obligation of the State to ensure that students studying in recognised Madarsas attain a minimum level of competency which will allow them to effectively participate in society and earn a living (¶72).Madarsa Act is a regulatory statuteThe Supreme Court held that The legislative scheme of the Madarsa Act shows that it is not a law to provide religious instruction; rather it has been enacted to regulate the standard of education in Madarsas (¶65). The Court held that the State has an interest in ensuring that minority educational institutions provide standards of education similar to other educational institutions and it can enact regulatory measures to raise educational standards (¶¶74-75).The Supreme Court held that the High Court was wrong in holding that education provided under the Madarsa Act is violative of Article 21A. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (“RTE Act”), which facilitates the fulfilment of the fundamental right under Article 21A, does not apply to minority educational institutions. The Court also observed that the state government has sufficient regulatory powers under the Madarsa Act to regulate standards of education in Madarsas (¶79).State of Uttar Pradesh has the legislative competence to enact the Madarsa ActThe Supreme Court held that the state legislature of Uttar Pradesh was competent to enact The Madarsa Act under Entry 25, List III (“Education” under the Concurrent List). The Court held that just because the education which is sought to be regulated includes some religious teachings or instruction does not push the legislation outside the legislative competence of the state (¶85).The Court held that Entry 25 of List III can not be interpreted to mean that only education that is devoid of any religious teaching or instruction is allowed to be regulated else it would fall outside the legislative competence of the state (¶90). The Court ruled that this interpretation would be against the constitutional scheme given that Article 30 expressly recognises the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions (¶86).Some provisions of the Madarsa Act conflict with the UGC ActThe Supreme Court held that the UGC Act has been enacted by Parliament under Entry 66 of List I (‘standards for higher education’ in the Union List). The Court observed that it had held in several cases that the UGC Act occupies the field concerning the coordination and determination of standards in higher education. Further, Entry 25 of List III is expressly subject to, and thus subordinate to, Entry 66 of List I. Therefore, the Madarsa Act, to the extent that it seeks to regulate higher education, is in conflict with the UGC Act and would be beyond the legislative competence of the state legislature (¶93). Thus, the provisions of the Madarsa Act which regulate higher education, such as the degrees of Kamil and Fazil (Bachelor's level and Post-graduate degree) are unconstitutional (¶99). However, the Court observed that the regulation of these higher education degrees is separable from the remainder of the Madarsa Act. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that only the provisions which pertain to Fazil and Kamil are unconstitutional and the rest of the Madarsa Act is valid (¶¶102-103).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"
7,05-11-2024,PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION vs STATE OF MAHARASHTRA .C.A. No. 1012/2002,"Scope of the words ""material resources of the community"" under Article 39(b) of the Constitution","PROPERTY OWNERS ASSOCIATION V. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA .2024 INSC 835 (5 November 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice B.V. Nagarathna, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Rajesh Bindal, Justice Satish C. Sharma, Justice Augustine G. MasihQuestion(s):   (i) What is the correct interpretation of Article 31C of the Constitution after the judgment of Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980 INSC 142 ) (“Minerva Mills”)? (ii) Whether privately owned property constitutes ‘material resources of the community’ which can be acquired and distributed by the state in furtherance of  Article 39(b) of the Constitution. Factual Background:  The State of Maharashtra enacted the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976 (“MHADA”) to facilitate the reconstruction of old dangerous buildings and improve slum areas. In 1986, the State of Maharashtra amended MHADA to include Chapter VIII-A, which allowed for the acquisition of redeveloped properties for the erstwhile occupiers. Section 1A was also inserted in the MHADA, which states that MHADA gives effect to a State policy specified in Clause (b) of Article 39 of the Constitution. Article 39(b) provides that the State shall ensure that ownership and control over “material resources of the community” are distributed to serve the common good.The constitutional validity of Chapter VIIIA was challenged in the Bombay High Court. On 13 December 1991, the High Court held that Chapter VIII-A was saved by Article 31-C, as it gave effect to the principles laid down in Article 39(b). Article 31-C says that laws giving effect to the principles in Article 39(b) and (c) cannot be struck down for violating Articles 14 (equality) and Article 19 (right to freedom).The Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court, which, on 1 May 1996, referred the matter to a larger bench because it found that the interpretation of Article 31-C was disputed. On 21 March 2001, a Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court, referred the case to a Seven-Judge Bench because it observed that the correctness of Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing v. Bharat Coking Coal (1982 INSC 93) (“Sanjeev Coke”), which itself was decided by seven judges, needed to be reconsidered. This was because Sanjeev Coke relied on a concurring but minority opinion by Justice Krishna Iyer in State of Karnataka v. Ranganatha Reddy (1977 INSC 196) (“Ranganatha Reddy”) regarding the interpretation of “material resources of the community”. On 19 February 2002, a Seven-Judge Bench referred the case to a Nine-Judge Bench to reconsider the broad view taken by the Nine-Judge Bench in Mafatlal Industries Ltd v. Union of India (1996 INSC 1514) regarding what types of property constituted “material resources of the community” under Article 39(b).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court by a 7-2 majority held that not all private property constitutes ‘material resources of the community’ in Articles 39(b) and (c) to be acquired and redistributed by the State. It overruled the decision of Sanjeev Coke which held that private resources also come under the material resources of the community. The judgment for the majority was written by Chief Justice Candrachud. Justice Nagarathna authored a separate partly dissenting opinion holding that all privately owned resources except for “personal effects” can constitute “material resources of the community” and private property can be “transformed” into community resources through  processes such as nationalisation or acquisition. Justice Dhulia also delivered a dissenting opinion holding that income and wealth inequality are enormous and the broad interpretation of “material resources of the community” adopted in Ranganatha Reddy and Sanjiv Coke is correct. All Nine Judges held that Article 31-C continues to prevent statutes from being struck down for violating Articles 14 and 19 if they give effect to Articles 39(b) and (c), as interpreted in this judgement. The constitutionality of the MHADA will now be decided by a regular bench based on the principles laid down in this case.Reasons for the Decision:  Invalidation of an amendment revives the unamended textThe interpretation of Article 31-C was disputed because an amendment to Article 31-C had been struck down and a question arose as to whether the text as it stood before the amendment continued to have effect. The Supreme Court held that when an amendment is struck down, the original unamended text is revived unless there was clear legislative intent to repeal the amended provision independently. The Court observed that invalidating the amended text without enforcing the original (unamended) text would create a gap in the law, leaving an area entirely unregulated contrary to legislative intent, which may lead to potentially absurd results, and even create a constitutional crisis (¶¶57-60 J. Chandrachud, ¶3 J. Nagarathna, ¶1J. Dhulia). The Supreme Court ruled that, when amending Article 31-C, the legislature only intended to modify and not repeal the Article. The Court also observed that the unamended text of Article 31-C had itself been challenged and upheld in Kesavananda Bharati v. Union of India (“Kesavananda Bharati”) (1973 INSC 91). Thus, after the amendment to Article 31-C was struck down in Minerva Mills, the unamended Article 31-C stood revived. To hold otherwise would be to indirectly strike down language previously upheld in Kesavananda Bharti. Thus, Article 31-C continues to protect legislation giving effect to the principles of Articles 39(b) and (c) (¶¶55,70-71 J. Chandrachud, ¶3 J. Nagarathna, ¶2 J. Dhulia).Correctness of Sanjeev Coke and cases following Ranganathan ReddyThe majority observed that Sanjeev Coke incorrectly relied on the minority view in Ranganatha Reddy. A concurring opinion by a minority of judges does not serve as binding precedent unless it is undisputed by the majority and forms part of the judgment's core reasoning (¶¶99-100). The majority in Ranganatha Reddy expressly disagreed with Justice Krishna Iyer's interpretation of Article 39(b) and clarified that they did not adopt his view, thus precluding future reliance on his interpretation. Therefore, the Five-Judge bench in Sanjeev Coke should have followed the majority view in Ranganatha Reddy, rather than the minority’s view (¶¶102, 104-105). The majority also held that Mafatlal’s reliance on Ranganathan Reddy was purely incidental and limited to the socio-economic values espoused by Article 39(b) (¶¶120,127 J. Chandrachud, ¶20 J. Nagarathna). However, Justice Dhulia in his dissent held that as the majority in Ranganath Reddy had been silent on the issue, and the concurring opinion in Ranganatha Reddy had reached the same conclusion as the majority, but only by a different reasoning, the concurring opinion in Ranganatha Reddy could be followed (¶¶28-29 J.Dhulia). Not all privately owned property forms part of the material resources of the communityThe majority judgment held that while the Constitution embodies ideals of ""economic democracy,"" it does not prescribe a single economic model, leaving future generations free to choose the path toward economic justice (¶¶153, 168). The majority reasoned that an interpretation of Article 39(b) which places all private property within the net of the phrase “material resources of the community” only satisfies one of the three requirements of the phrase, i.e., that the goods in question must be a ‘resource’. However, it ignores the elements that they must be “material” and “of the community”. It ruled that the words “material” and “community” must also be given effect. It held that the words “of the community” must be understood as separate from the “individual” (¶211).The majority, however, also held that the use of the word “of the community” rather than “of the state” indicated a specific intention to include some privately owned resources (¶211 J. Chandrachud). However, the majority ruled that to hold that all private property can be acquired and redistributed through State action would violate the constitutional protection of the right to property (¶220). The majority outlined certain principles to determine whether privately owned resources are covered by Article 39(b): (i) the nature of the resource and its inherent characteristics; (ii) the impact of the resource on the well-being of the community; (iii); the scarcity of the resource; and (iv) the consequences of such a resource being concentrated in the hands of private owners (¶222). In her separate opinion, Justice Nagarathna observed that all privately owned material resources should be first converted into the “material resources of the community” and only then can be distributed to serve the common good (¶¶7.8-7.9, 11.8, 12.3 J. Nagarathna), except personal belongings (¶7.6 J. Nagarathna). The States may transform private property into material resources of the community either by way of nationalisation, acquisition or vesting of such resources with the State (¶11.9 J. Nagarathna). The owner of private property must be fairly compensated for their losses when their resources are transformed into the resources of the community  (¶11.10 J. Nagarathna). She also observed that any policy or law to enforce Article 39(b) is protected under Article 31C but its implementation should not violate Article 14 (¶13.11 J. Nagarathna).Justice Dhulia in his dissent observed that the phrase “material resources of the community must be given an expansive meaning  (¶48 J.Dhulia). It is the task of the legislature to decide what and when privately owned resources that serve the common good form part of the material resources of the community (¶49 J.Dhulia). The social inequalities that existed at the time of commencement of the Constitution still exist and therefore the principles laid down in Articles 38 and 39 cannot be abandoned (¶¶35, 45, 50 J.Dhulia).Prepared by Osama Noor and Benila B MCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"
8,23-10-2024,STATE OF U.P. . vs M/S. LALTA PRASAD VAISH AND SONSC.A. No. 151/2007,State’s Power to Regulate Industrial Alcohol,"STATE OF U.P. . V. M/S. LALTA PRASAD VAISH AND SONS2024 INSC 812 (23 October 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Bengaluru V. Nagarathna, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, Justice Satish C. Sharma, Justice Augustine G. Masih.Question(s):  (i) Whether the term ""intoxicating liquors"" in Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule (the State List) of the Constitution of India includes ‘industrial alcohol’ within its scope. (ii) Does a state legislature possess the legislative competence to enact laws regulating ‘industrial alcohol?’Factual Background:  Alcohol is categorized into two categories, potable (drinkable) liquor and industrial alcohol. Sometimes potable liquor is produced illegally by processing industrial alcohol. The production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, and transport of “intoxicating liquors” falls under Entry 8 of List II (the State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.In 1990, a Seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Synthetics & Chemicals v. State of U.P (“Synthetics”) (1989 INSC 321) held that ‘intoxicating liquor’ under Entry 8 of the State List only includes potable liquor and therefore, the State Legislature cannot pass laws regarding industrial alcohol. It also held that Section 18G of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act 1951(“IDRA”) was a comprehensive provision by Parliament which excluded the State’s power to regulate industrial alcohol under Entry 33 of List III (the Concurrent List). Entry 33 allows both the state and Union governments to make laws on the products of any industry, even if Parliament had granted the Union Government power to regulate an industry in the public interest. Section 18G of IDRA empowers the Union Government to regulate the supply, distribution, trade and commerce of any scheduled industry for securing equitable distribution and fair prices.Subsequently, on 25 May 1999, the Government of Uttar Pradesh issued a notification under the U.P. Licenses for the Possession of Denatured Spirit and Specially Denatured Spirit Rules, 1976, imposing a 15% licence fee on the sale of specially denatured spirits (alcohol with additives making it unsuitable for consumption). The Respondent challenged the notification, arguing that the state had no power to regulate denatured spirits given Section 18-G of the IDRA. On 12 February 2004, the Allahabad High Court struck down Uttar Pradesh’s notification. The State of U.P. appealed to the Supreme Court.In 2007, a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in State of U.P v. Lalta Prasad Vaish observed that the Seven-Judge Bench decision in Synthetics needed reconsideration by a larger bench. Subsequently, a Constitution Bench (five judges) referred the matter to a Nine-Judge Bench for consideration.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Nine-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court by an 8:1 majority upheld a State Legislature’s power to regulate industrial alcohol and overruled the judgement in Synthetics. Chief Justice Chandrachud authored the majority opinion on behalf of Justice Roy, Justice Oka, Justice Pardiwala, Justice Misra, Justice Bhuyan, Justice Sharma and Justice Masih while Justice Nagarathna authored a dissenting opinion.The majority held that the expression “intoxicating liquors” under Entry 8 of the State List was inclusive of all kinds of alcohol which are detrimental to health. This includes denatured spirits used as raw materials to produce potable alcohol. Thus, the IDRA must be interpreted as excluding “intoxicating liquors” as interpreted in this judgment. Given the finding that industrial alcohol fell under Entry 8 of the State List, the majority held it was not necessary to decide whether orders under Section 18G of the IDRA excluded states’ power to regulate products under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List.Justice Nagarathna, in her dissenting opinion, held that ‘industrial alcohol’ is distinct from “intoxicating liquors” asserting that while States have the authority to regulate ‘intoxicating liquor’ intended for human consumption, they lack the legislative competence to legislate ‘industrial alcohol’ because of Entry 52 of List I of the Seventh Schedule (industries which the Union Government controls in the public interest) and the statutory framework of the IDRA.Reasons for the Decision:  Harmonious InterpretationThe Supreme Court held that when there is a conflict between the entries in the Union List and the State List, the power of Parliament prevails. The Court also observed that whenever a conflict between the legislative powers of the Union and States arises, the Court must read the entries harmoniously and the federal supremacy of the Parliament should be invoked only when there is an irreconcilable conflict (¶¶43-46 CJ. Chandrachud).Parliament does not have the legislative competence to take over the control of the industry of intoxicating liquor.The majority observed that if Parliament legislates on an industry under Entry 52 of the Union list, it should satisfy the condition mentioned under Entry 52 which is that the control of that particular industry by the Union must be in the public interest (¶¶52-54 CJ. Chandrachud). Parliament cannot occupy a regulatory area merely by issuing a declaration under Entry 52, the state legislature’s power is only limited to the extent of the law passed by Parliament (¶140(b) CJ. Chandrachud).The majority observed that ordinarily Entry 52 of Union List covered industries while Entry 33 of Concurrent List covered products, which both the States and Union could regulate. However, in the case of Entry 8, the Entry covered not only the product, but the entire industry (¶¶56-58 CJ. Chandrachud). Thus, there was an overlap between Entry 52 of the Union List and Entry 8 of the State List on the subject of ‘intoxicating liquor’ and a harmonious interpretation could be arrived at only by excluding the industry either from Entry 52 of the Union List or Entry 8 of the State List (¶71 CJ. Chandrachud). The Court held that since Entry 52 of the Union list was a general entry for industries while Entry 8 of the State List was a special entry for “intoxicating liquors”, the special entry must prevail (¶71 CJ. Chandrachud). Therefore, Parliament does not have legislative competence to pass laws regulating ‘intoxicating liquor’ under Entry 52 (¶¶71-72 CJ. Chandrachud).Meaning of the expression ‘intoxicating liquor’The majority observed that the meaning of ‘intoxicating liquor’ in Entry 8 of the State List had been expanded beyond the narrow definition of intoxicating alcoholic beverages in the Southern Pharmaceuticals & Chemicals v. State of Kerala (1981 INSC 154) case and does not have a fixed legislative meaning (¶¶82, 87 CJ. Chandrachud). The Court noted that liquids which contain alcohol and can possibly be used for intoxicating effects have also been included within the phrase ‘intoxicating liquor’ (¶82 CJ. Chandrachud). Further, it was observed by the majority that Entry 8 of the State List included every stage (from production to consumption) regarding “intoxicating liquors” to prevent them from being used noxiously (¶112 CJ. Chandrachud).In her dissenting opinion, Justice Nagarathna distinguished ‘industrial alcohol’ from potable alcohol based on its intended uses. While industrial alcohol may have intoxicating effects if misused, it is primarily designed for non-consumable purposes and is not intended for ingestion as a beverage (¶¶12.18-12.21 J. Nagarathna). Conversely, “intoxicating liquors” specifically refer to beverages meant for direct consumption. The key factor is the product's nature and its potential to cause intoxication when consumed directly (¶12.14 J. Nagarathna). Justice Nagarathna emphasised that ‘consumption’ should be understood as the act of direct consumption by drinking, excluding indirect uses of alcohol as a raw material in industrial, medicinal, or personal care products (¶12.14 J. Nagarathna).On the application of Section 18G of Industries (Development and Regulation) Act 1951The majority held that given its the finding that denatured alcohol is covered under the expression “intoxicating liquors” in Entry 8 of the State List, the issue of whether Section 18G of the IDRA prevents States from regulating ‘intoxicating liquor’ under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List does not arise for adjudication (¶139 CJ. Chandrachud).In her dissenting opinion, Justice Nagarathna asserted that denatured alcohol belongs to the family of ‘industrial alcohol’ (not fit for human consumption) and therefore, Section 18G of the IDRA has a bearing on the said product (¶¶10.3, 10.7 J. Nagarathna). Justice Nagarathna found that the mere enactment of section 18G of the IDRA gives rise to a presumption that Parliament and the Union Government intended to encompass the entire scope of Entry 33(a) in List III, thereby removing the States’ authority to legislate on the subject (¶17 J. Nagarathna). The IDRA, established under Entry 52 of List I, allows the Union Government to exercise control over scheduled industries. Justice Nagarathna highlighted that the amendment made in 2016 to the First Schedule of IDRA explicitly excluded potable alcohol from the definition of ‘Fermentation Industries,’ in the IDRA, thereby encompassing only non-potable alcohol like industrial alcohol (¶16.10 J. Nagarathna). She emphasised that the mere possibility of converting industrial alcohol into “intoxicating liquors” does not empower state legislatures to impose taxes or regulations on it (¶11.2 J. Nagarathna).Prepared by Raza Zaidi and Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning | Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

9,17-10-2024,IN RE SECTION 6A OF THE CITIZENSHIP ACT 1955 vs W.P.(C) No. 274/2009,"Constitutional challenge against Section 6A of Citizenship Act, 1955","IN RE SECTION 6A OF THE CITIZENSHIP ACT 1955 V. 2024 INSC 789 (17 October 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Surya Kant, Justice M.M. Sundresh, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MishraQuestion(s):  Whether Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 (“Citizenship Act”) violates Articles 11 (power to regulate citizenship), 14 (equality), 29 (protection of minority interests), 326 (right to vote), and 355 (duty of Union to protect states) of the Constitution.Factual Background:  Following the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, there was an influx of immigrants into Assam. Various groups protested against the influx of immigrants resulting in the signing of the Assam Accord on 15 August 1985 between the Union Government and the protesting groups. To provide legislative effect to the Assam Accord, Parliament enacted Section 6A in the Citizenship Act in 1985.Under Section 6A, immigrants of Indian origin who entered Assam before 1 January 1966 were recognised as Indian citizens. Further, those who arrived between 1 January 1966 and 24 March 1971 were to be granted citizenship subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions including; (i) their detection as a ‘foreigner’ by the Foreigners Tribunal; (ii) their continuing to be an ordinary resident of Assam since entering Assam; and (iii) deletion of their names from the electoral rolls for ten years. All those who satisfied these conditions were to be granted citizenship after ten years.Several writ petitions were filed under Article 32 challenging the constitutional validity of Section 6A, contending that: Parliament was not empowered to enact such a law under Articles 6, 7, and 11 of the Constitution; Section 6A violated the right to equality and the rights of minorities under Articles 14 and 29; and the duty of the Union to protect the State of Assam from external aggression under Article 355 of the Constitution. On 17 December 2014, a Division Bench of the Supreme Court (Two Judges) noted the important constitutional issues in the case and referred the matter to a Constitution Bench (Five Judges).Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Constitution Bench (five judges) of the Supreme Court by a majority of 4:1 upheld the constitutional validity of Section 6A. Justice Kant on behalf of himself and Justices Sundresh and Mishra authored the majority opinion and Chief Justice Chandrachud authored a separate concurring opinion. Justice Pardiwala authored a dissenting judgment declaring Section 6A invalid.In response to the contention that Section 6A was not being adequately enforced, the majority issued the following directions:The directions issued in Sarbananda Sonowal v Union of India (2005 INSC 287) should be followed to deport the illegal migrants who entered after 1971.The provisions of the Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950 should be integrated with Section 6A for identifying illegal immigrants.The current statutory framework and tribunals for identifying illegal immigrants in Assam are inadequate and must be enhanced to enforce the legislative intent of Section 6A in a time-bound manner.Reasons for the Decision:  Objections on the maintainabilityThe Supreme Court held that courts have the power to review a foreign policy when it is in the form of a statute (¶¶46, 53 J. Kant, ¶¶6-8J. Pardiwala). Despite the Petitioners approaching the Court many years after Section 6A was enacted, the Court held that the doctrine of laches (delay) would not proscribe the Petitioner’s claim as it affects the larger public interest and the constitutionality of a provision (¶¶69-72, 75 J. Kant, ¶8 J. Pardiwala).Section 6A conforms with Part II of the constitutionThe majority held that Section 6A aligns with the fundamental purpose of Articles 6 and 7 of the Constitution, which seek to provide citizenship to individuals of Indian origin who suffered from political disturbances in neighbouring nations (¶132 J. Kant). In any case, the provisions in Part II of the Constitution (Arts 5-11) only prescribe who would be granted citizenship at the commencement of the Constitution. Citizenship after the commencement of the Constitution would be governed by Parliamentary law (¶139 J. Kant, ¶¶31,39,40 J. Chandrachud). Chief Justice Chandrachud held that Article 246 read with Entry 17 of List I in the Seventh Schedule confers Parliament the power to enact laws on citizenship (¶¶34-35 J. Chandrachud).Justice Pardiwala in his dissenting opinion held that Section 6A is not similar to Articles 6 and 7 because Section 6A(3) of the Citizenship Act puts the burden on the State to determine suspected immigrants as opposed to requiring individuals to register for citizenship (¶12). Justice Pardiwala also noted that unlike Article 6, Section 6A does not specify a cut-off date till when applications for citizenship could be made. The different onus of identifying foreigners and the lack of a cut-off date made Section 6A different from Article 6 (¶¶12, 212).Section 6A does not violate Article 14The Supreme Court held that Section 6A does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution. Article 14 allows the legislature to classify individuals into different groups and treat them differently but such classifications must be based on an intelligible differentia and have a reasonable connection to the purpose sought to be achieved by classifying individuals(¶¶168-177 J.Kant, ¶¶59, 68c J. Chandrachud). Assam, with a high influx of migrants and a small area, faces unique challenges in comparison with other states and therefore treating the situation in Assam is an intelligible classification (¶¶202-205 J.Kant). The federal structure allows the Union Government to have separate treaty arrangements with the states and Section 6A was inserted to bring the Assam Accord into effect (¶¶192, 188 J.Kant, ¶71 Chandrachud). This provides a sufficient reason for Parliament to have enacted Section 6A solely for the State of Assam (¶189 J.Kant, ¶15 J. Pardiwala).Section 6A is not arbitrary or unreasonableThe majority found that there were historical reasons for the different cut-off dates and legitimate reasons for categorising migrants (¶¶232, 238-239, 241 J.Kant, ¶75 Chandrachud). As those who suffered political turmoil and entered Assam before 1 January 1966 were already included in the electoral rolls and 25 March 1971 marked the date of beginning of the Bangladesh Liberation war and the date of grant of Bangladeshi citizenship under the Bangladesh Citizenship (Temporary Provisions) Order, 1972, there was a valid rationale for the cut off dates (¶¶228-231 J.Kant).Therefore, Section 6A is not manifestly arbitrary because there was careful consideration behind the different cut-off dates. Further, the term “ordinary residence” in Section 6A is not too vague to be undefined (¶273 J. Kant).In his dissent, Justice Pardiwala observed that there was no time limit by when all immigrants who entered Assam between 1966-71 had to be identified and could claim the benefits of Section 6A (¶¶129-130, 139 J. Pardiwala). Justice Pardiwala also observed that Section 6A(3) does not permit an immigrant to voluntarily seek citizenship. Rather, an immigrant has to wait, potentially indefinitely, for a reference to be made by the State to the Foreigners Tribunal (¶175 J. Pardiwala). Finally, Justice Pardiwala also observed that the requirement that the immigrant be an “ordinary resident in Assam” was vague and encouraged immigrants from neighbouring Indian states to immigrate to Assam to claim the benefit of Section 6A(3) (¶186 J. Pardiwala).Justice Pardiwala in his dissent observed that the goal of Section 6A(3) was the effective identification of immigrants between 1966 and 1971. He ruled that the above-mentioned flaws of Section 6A meant that the provision no longer achieves this goal and is hence unreasonable and unjustified (¶¶169, 189 J. Pardiwala). Justice Pardiwala ruled that the circumstances that existed at the time of the Assam Accord do not justify the continued operation of this arbitrary mechanism of establishing citizenship (¶190 J. Pardiwala).Justice Pardiwala in his dissenting opinion held that the Supreme Court has the power to mould relief to do complete justice to avoid the possibility of chaos and confusion that may be caused in the society. Therefore, he declared Section 6A as unconstitutional with prospective effect to ensure that immigrants who have already claimed the benefit of Section 6A are not deprived of citizenship (¶206 J. Pardiwala).In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Chandrachud held that Section 6A contemplated rules and sufficient infrastructure to ensure that immigrants of Indian origin from Bangladesh could acquire citizenship (¶119 J. Chandrachud). Section 6A continues to serve this goal however, increased State capacity is needed to ensure the effective implementation of the provision. However, this does not render Section 6A unconstitutional (¶120 J.Chandrachud).Section 6A does not violate the right of the indigenous people under Article 29(1)The majority acknowledged that Assam has a distinct language, culture and script which are entitled to be preserved under Article 29(1) (¶288 J. Kant, ¶92 J. Chandrachud). However, it found that Section 6A provides for timely detection and deportation of illegal immigrants. Thus the challenge should be against the non-implementation of the statute and not its constitutionality (¶304 J. Kant).Chief Justice Chandrachud observed that the mere presence of different ethnic groups cannot violate the right under Article 29(1) and various constitutional and statutory provisions provide for the protection of their distinct culture (¶¶100-102 J. Chandrachud).Duty of a state under Article 355The majority acknowledged that the Union Government holds a duty under Article 355 to protect its citizens from external aggression and internal disturbance (¶351 J.Kant, ¶87 J. Chandrachud). Although unabated migration could constitute external aggression, Section 6A does not promote unrestricted migration. It provides a regulated approach for the grant of citizenship to migrants who entered before 1971 and this cannot amount to external aggression (¶¶363-365 J.Kant).In his concurrence, Chief Justice Chandrachud observed that while Article 355 does cast a duty on the Union Government, there is no corresponding right under Article 355 and thus a legislative enactment cannot be challenged on the ground that it breaches Article 355 (¶¶87,89 J. Chandrachud). Considering Article 355 as a separate ground for judicial review would defeat the object of the provision and the federal structure of the Constitution (¶¶89,90 J. Chandrachud).Prepared by Benila B M and Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

10,15-10-2024,OMKAR vs THE UNION OF INDIAC.A. No. 10611/2024,Disqualification from an educational course cannot be solely based on quantified disability.,"OMKAR V. THE UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 775 (15 October 2024)Justices:    Justice Bhushan R Gavai, Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Kalpathy V. ViswanathanQuestion(s):   Should a candidate with more than 40% speech and language disability be disqualified from obtaining admission under the PwD category for the MBBS course solely based on the quantification of their disability?Factual Background:   The Appellant had a speech and language disability. In 2024, the Appellant qualified for admission to the MBBS Course under the PwD category of the NEET UG exam. The National Medical Commission (“NMC”) guidelines prohibited students with more than 40% permanent disability from pursuing the MBBS course. The Appellant obtained a Disability Certificate after undergoing a medical examination before a Disability Assessment Board which quantified his disability at 45% and recorded that the Appellant was not eligible to pursue a medical course as per the NMC guidelines.The Appellant approached the Bombay High Court challenging the legal validity of the NMC’s eligibility criteria for PwD category admissions. The High Court dismissed his petition. Subsequently, the Appellant approached the Supreme Court seeking urgent relief to participate in the counselling process for admission. On 2 September 2024, the Supreme Court issued an interim order directing that the seat the Appellant would have been entitled to if rendered eligible, be kept vacant. The Court also directed Maulana Azad Medical College to constitute a Medical Board to determine whether the speech and language disability of the Appellant would come in his way of pursuing the MBBS. In its report, the Medical Board opined that the Appellant’s speech and language disability would not hinder the Appellant from pursuing the MBBS Course.Decision of the Supreme Court:   A Three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, based on the report submitted by the Medical Board, granted admission to the Appellant in the MBBS course. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Viswanathan.The Supreme Court held that the role of Disability Assessment Boards is not to merely quantify the disability of a candidate but to assess whether they can pursue the course in question. In this regard, the following directions were issued: (i) Disability Assessment Boards must positively record whether the disability would impede the candidate's ability to complete the course. If the Board concludes that a candidate is ineligible, it must provide reasons for its decision; (ii) Pending the creation of an appellate body, the decisions of the Disability Assessment Boards will be subject to judicial review. The courts should refer such cases to any premier medical institute for an independent opinion and decide accordingly.Reasons for the Decision:   State’s responsibility towards Persons with DisabilityThe Supreme Court observed that Article 41 of the Constitution creates a responsibility upon the State to secure the right to education for all persons including for persons with disabilities (¶16). Further, the Court observed that Sections 2(m), 2(r), 2(y), 3, 15 and 32 of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016, which were enacted to give effect to the United Nations Convention on the Right of Persons with Disability, imposes several obligations upon the State to empower such persons by ensuring equality, accessibility, and protecting them from discrimination (¶18).Purposive Interpretation of Appendix H-1 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations,1997The Supreme Court observed that a literal reading of ‘Appendix H-I’ of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 1997 inserted by the 2019 amendment created a peculiar situation where candidates with less than 40% disability could pursue MBBS courses but were ineligible for the 5% PwD reservation, while the candidates with more than 40% were not eligible for the course at all (¶20). The Court noted that a literal interpretation of the Regulations would mean that no one is eligible for the 5% PwD reservation, and such an interpretation cannot be accepted (¶20). The Court further held that treating all candidates with a benchmark disability above 40% as ineligible, without distinguishing between those who, in the opinion of the Medical Board, can or cannot pursue the course would treat unequals equally (¶22). This would violate the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution (¶22). Prepared by Raza Haider ZaidiCentre for Research and Planning | Supreme Court of India"
11,03-10-2024,SUKANYA SHANTHA vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 1404/2023,Challenge to caste-based discrimination in prisons,"SUKANYA SHANTHA V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 753 (3 October 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MishraQuestion(s):  Whether provisions in the Prison Manuals of various States which distinguish between inmates based on caste are unconstitutional.Factual Background:  Sukanya Shantha (“Petitioner”), a journalist, wrote an article titled “From Segregation to Labour, Manu’s Caste Law Governs the Indian Prison System” which was published on 10 December 2020. The article highlighted caste-based discrimination in prisons. The Petitioner subsequently approached the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the constitutionality of various provisions in State Prison Manuals.Some of the Prison Manual provisions challenged stated that: (i) A convict sentenced to simple imprisonment shall not be called upon to perform duties of a degrading or menial character unless he belongs to a class or community accustomed to performing such duties; (ii) A convict overseer may be appointed as a night guard provided he does not belong to any class that may have a strong natural tendency to escape, such as men of wandering tribes; (iii) Food shall be cooked and carried to the cells by prisoner-cooks of suitable caste; (iv) Sweepers should be chosen from the Mether or Hari caste, also from the Chandal or other castes, if by the custom of the district they perform similar work when free; and (v) Any prisoner in a jail who is of so high a caste that he cannot eat food cooked by the existing cooks shall be appointed a cook and be made to cook for the full complement of men.The Petitioner argued that caste-based discrimination continues to persist in prisons The States of Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu appeared before the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court held that the challenged Prison Manual provisions were unconstitutional and violated the following articles of the Constitution: Article 14 (equality), Article 15 (prohibition of caste discrimination), Article 17 (abolition of untouchability), Article 21 (life and liberty), and Article 23 (forced labour). The Court ordered the States to revise their prison manuals within three months. It also asked for a status report from the states. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Classification based on caste under the Prison Manuals is unconstitutionalThe Supreme Court held that the Government can differentiate between citizens based on caste only to create protective policies for marginalised castes and not to further discrimination (¶164). The Court held that the caste classification done in the Prison Manuals had no rational nexus with the object of the classification, which was the orderly running of prisons and reforming inmates (¶165). The Supreme Court held that the Prison Manual rules reinforce the occupational immobility of prisoners of certain castes, which contributes to institutional discrimination, depriving inmates of an equal opportunity to reform (¶¶185-186). The Court held that provisions which differentiate between citizens based on “habit”, “custom”, “superior mode of living”, and “natural tendency to escape” are unconstitutionally vague and indeterminate (¶168).The Supreme Court held that by assigning cleaning and sweeping work to marginalised castes, while allowing the “high” castes to do cooking, the Manuals directly discriminate based on caste and thus violate Article 15(1) of the Constitution (¶171). The Supreme Court also held that the Manuals indirectly discriminate against marginalised castes by using broad phrases such as “menial” jobs to be performed by castes “accustomed to perform such duties.” While such phrases may appear to be neutral, they refer to marginalised communities. These provisions disproportionately harm marginalised castes and perpetuate caste-based labour divisions (¶172). The Supreme Court held that only such classification that proceeds from an objective inquiry of factors such as work aptitude, accommodation needs, and special medical and psychological needs of the prisoner would pass a test of reasonable classification (¶169).Discrimination against de-notified tribes is unconstitutionalThe Supreme Court held that the Prison Manual rule which prevented members of de-notified tribes from being overseers reinforces a stereotype which excludes them from meaningful participation in social life (¶¶174-175). These stereotypes not only criminalise entire communities but also reinforce caste-based prejudices. They resemble a form of untouchability, as they assign certain negative traits to specific groups based on identity, perpetuating their marginalisation and exclusion (¶183). The Court ruled that discrimination against de-notified tribes is prohibited under Article 15(1) as it is a form of caste discrimination (¶175).Notion of UntouchabilityThe Supreme Court held that some of the provisions of the Prison Manuals which assigned “degrading or menial” work to certain castes were unconstitutional. The Court ruled that the notion that an occupation is considered “degrading or menial” is an aspect of the caste system and untouchability (¶179). The provision that food shall be cooked by a “suitable caste” reflects notions of untouchability. The Court held that the division of work based on caste is a practice of untouchability prohibited under the Constitution under Article 17 (¶180).Caste-based division of labour is forced labour under Article 23The Supreme Court ruled that forcing marginalised caste inmates to perform tasks like cleaning latrines or sweeping, without providing them any choice in the matter amounts to “forced labour” under Article 23 because it strips individuals of their liberty to engage in meaningful work, and denies them the opportunity to rise above the constraints imposed by their social identity (¶¶193-195).Need of change in the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023The Supreme Court ruled that a provision prohibiting all forms of caste discrimination in prisons should be inserted in the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 (“Model Act 2023) (¶210).The Supreme Court also ruled that the definition of “Habitual Offender” under Section 2(12) of the Model Act 2023 is vague and over-broad (¶211). The Court also held that the classification of “habitual offender” in the Prison Manuals has been used to target members of de-notified tribes and this can not be allowed (¶218). However, since habitual offender laws were not in challenge in this case, the Court urged the State governments to reconsider the usage of various habitual offender laws. In the meantime, the Court held that the definition of “habitual offender” in the prison manuals/rules shall be interpreted per the definition provided in the habitual offender legislation enacted by the respective State legislature, subject to any constitutional challenge against such legislation in the future. The Court held that if there is no habitual offender legislation in the State, the references to habitual offenders directly or indirectly in Prison Manuals, as discussed in this judgment, would be struck down as unconstitutional (¶219).Directions to the Union Government and StatesThe Supreme Court held that the “caste” column and any references to caste in undertrial and/or convicts’ prisoners’ registers inside the prisons shall be deleted. The Court directed the All States and Union Territories to revise their Prison Manuals/Rules per this judgment within three months. The Court also directed the Union government to make necessary changes, as highlighted in this judgment, to address caste-based discrimination in the Model Prison Manual 2016 and the Model Act 2023 within three months.The Supreme Court took cognizance of the discrimination inside prisons on any grounds such as caste, gender, or disability and listed the case after three months to check compliance of this judgment. The Court also directed the District Legal Services Authority of the states and the Board of Visitors formed under the Model Prison Manual 2016 to jointly conduct regular inspections of prisons to identify whether caste-based discrimination or similar discriminatory practices as highlighted in this judgment, were still taking place and submit a report to the Supreme Court.Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

12,26-09-2024,V. SENTHIL BALAJI vs THE DEPUTY DIRECTORCrl.A. No. 4011/2024,Power of constitutional courts to grant bail for offences in statutes with stringent bail conditions,"V. SENTHIL BALAJI V. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR2024 INSC 739 (26 September 2024)Justices:  Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Augustine G. MasihQuestion(s):  (i) When should constitutional courts grant bail for offences in statutes with stringent bail conditions? (ii) Whether Mr. V. Senthil Balaji (“the Appellant”) is entitled to bail.Factual Background:  The Appellant was a former Minister of Transport in the Government of Tamil Nadu. Three First Information Reports (“FIRs”) were registered against the Appellant between 2015-18 on the allegation that he, with his secretary and brother, collected large amounts of money to provide jobs to several persons in the transport department. The chargesheets name 2,000 accused persons alongside the Appellant and 600 state witnesses.Based on these alleged offences, on 29 July 2021 the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”) registered a case of money laundering against the Appellant under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”). Section 45 of the PMLA puts serious restrictions on the grant of bail by mandating a court hearing the bail application be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused person is not guilty of the offence and they are not likely to commit any offence while on bail. The ED arrested the Appellant on 14 June 2023. On 28 February 2018, the Madras High Court denied the Appellant’s request for bail. Therefore, he appealed to the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court granted bail to the Appellant subject to certain conditions including that he would mark his presence twice a week in the office of Deputy Director, ED in Chennai and he would surrender his passport to the PMLA Court. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Oka.Reasons for the Decision:  Effect of delay in the trialThe Supreme Court held that the existence of an underlying “scheduled” offence (referred to as “scheduled offences” because they are listed in the Schedule of the PMLA) is a must to prove the laundering of the “proceeds of crime” in a PMLA case (¶20). Proceeds of crime means property obtained directly or indirectly by a person as a result of the criminal activity of the scheduled offence. In other words, if the underlying scheduled offence is not proven, no question of laundering the proceeds of a crime can arise, as there is no underlying crime. Thus, the conclusion of the PMLA case is contingent on the trial in the underlying scheduled offence concluding (¶21).The Supreme Court found that in the Appellant’s case, even if he were to be convicted in the PMLA case, the maximum punishment which could be imposed would be seven years (¶14). The Appellant had already been in custody for over fifteen months (¶14). The Court ruled that considering the large number of accused persons, witnesses and voluminous documentary evidence, the likelihood of the trial of the underlying scheduled offences concluding even within a reasonable time of three to four years is not possible (¶17).Power of the constitutional courts in granting bailThe Supreme Court reiterated the principle that constitutional courts have the power to grant bail on the grounds of long incarceration and delay in the completion of trial for which the accused is not responsible, even in those offences in which there are higher thresholds for the grant of bail (¶24). The Court held that although Section 45 of the PMLA has a high threshold for granting bail, such provisions should not become tools to incarcerate accused persons without a trial (¶27). The Court ruled that if the incarceration of an undertrial accused is continued for an unreasonably long time, this would be violative of their right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution (¶26). Thus, the Court held that the Appellant’s indefinite detention would violate his right to liberty and a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution (¶27).The Supreme Court ruled that a reasonable time will depend on the provisions under which the accused is being tried and other factors such as the duration of the minimum and maximum sentence for the offence and any higher thresholds which a law provides for the grant of bail (¶27).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

13,23-09-2024,JUST RIGHTS FOR CHILDREN ALLIANCE vs S. HARISHCrl.A. No. 2161-2162/2024,"Whether viewing child sexual exploitation and abuse material is punishable under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012","JUST RIGHTS FOR CHILDREN ALLIANCE V. S. HARISH2024 INSC 716 (23 September 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud and Justice Jamshed B. PardiwalaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether viewing child sexual exploitation and abuse material (“CESAM”) is punishable under Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (“POCSO Act”) and Section 67B of the Information and Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”). (ii) Can Section 30 of the POCSO Act (statutory presumption of culpable mental state) be invoked in a quashing petition? Factual Background:  On 29 January 2020, the Police were informed that the accused person (“Respondent”) was an active consumer of CESAM (referred to as child pornography in the POCSO Act) and had allegedly downloaded material involving children on his mobile phone.Subsequently, an FIR was registered against the Respondent under Section 67B of the IT Act (electronically publishing or transmitting material depicting children in sexual acts) and Section 14(1) of the POCSO Act (Punishment for using children for pornographic purposes). During the investigation, the Respondent revealed that he used to watch pornography in college. The Computer Forensic Analysis Report also found that the Respondent’s mobile had CESAM stored in it. Thus, when the chargesheet was filed, Section 14(1) was dropped and Section 15(1) (storage or possession of any pornographic material involving a child but a failure to delete, destroy or report it with an intention to share such material) was invoked.The Respondent filed a petition to quash the criminal charges against him in the Madras High Court. On 11 January 2024, the High Court quashed the criminal proceedings by holding that mere watching or downloading of CESAM without any transmission or publication of the same was not an offence and the respondent had not used a child or children for pornographic purposes. The Appellants (a group of NGOs working against child trafficking and sexual exploitation) filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the High Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the High Court and restored the criminal proceedings against the Respondent. The Court held that the mere viewing of CESAM is punishable if no step has been taken to delete or report it. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Pardiwala.Reasons for the Decision:  Scope of Section 15 of the POCSOThe Supreme Court held that Section 15(1) of the POCSO Act penalises the storage or possession of any pornographic material involving a child, a failure to delete, destroy or report it, and an intention to share such material.The Supreme Court held that Section 15(1) does not require the actual transmission of any CESAM to be attracted (¶81). The Court ruled that Section 15(1) penalises the possession of CESAM when done with a particular intention or purpose to share it (¶81). The Supreme Court ruled that this form of criminal act in criminal jurisprudence is known as an ‘Inchoate Crime’ or ‘Inchoate Offence’ (criminal acts that are committed in preparation for a further offence) (¶81). The Court ruled that the conduct that is also penalized under Section 15 is the failure to delete, destroy or report any CESAM that was stored or in possession of any person with an intention to share the same (¶84).Viewing also amounts to possessionThe Supreme Court held that before the 2019 Amendment in the POCSO Act, Section 15 only criminalized the storage of any CESAM for any commercial purpose. The 2019 Amendment introduced possession of CESAM in Section 15 as a separate offence to deter the consumption and dissemination of CESAM (¶113). The Court held that possession would include constructive possession i.e., possession not on one’s person but possession through a device or location one has control over (¶114). This ensures that an accused cannot avoid punishment simply by physically distancing themselves from the unlawful material (¶117). The Supreme Court referred to decisions from the United States where individuals who sought out, viewed, and then deleted CESAM were deemed to be in constructive possession of the unlawful material (¶¶115-116). Relying on these decisions, the Court ruled that wherever a person views, CESAM, even without actually storing it in any device or in any form, this act would still be tantamount to ‘possession’ under Section 15 of the POCSO Act, if they exercised control over such material (¶118).No requirement of possession at the time of registration of the FIRThe Supreme Court observed that Section 15 of the POCSO Act does not specify when the person ‘stored’ or ‘possessed’ the CESAM and thus the offence occurs if it is established that the accused had ‘stored’ or ‘possessed’ CESAM with the specified intention at any point of time, even before the initiation of criminal proceedings (¶124).On the facts of the Case:The Supreme Court held that the CESAM that was recovered from the personal mobile phone of the Respondent which was regularly in use by him, prima facie established the storage or possession of CESAM. The Court further ruled that since the CESAM was found to have been stored in Respondent’s personal mobile phone since 2016 and 2019, prima facie it could be said there was a failure on the part of the Respondent to delete, destroy or report such material (¶203). The Court also rejected the Respondent's contention that he was genuinely ignorant about the law that mere storing CESAM was punishable under the POCSO Act (¶210-21).Presumption of Criminal Mental State under Section 30 of POCSOThe Supreme Court observed that the peculiar nature of the crime under Section 15 makes it difficult for the prosecution to establish through direct evidence that the person intended to share the material (¶167). The Court ruled that malicious intention is a key element in such inchoate crimes. Therefore, to assist the prosecution, Section 30 creates a rebuttable presumption that the malicious intention exists. Section 30 of the POCSO Act directs a court dealing with any offence under the POCSO Act which requires malicious intention to be proven presume the accused had such malicious intention (¶156). However, certain foundational facts regarding the occurrence of the offence must be made out before the presumption is applicable (¶171).Whether presumption under Section 30 can be used in quashing proceedingsThe Supreme Court held that when High Courts are deciding whether to quash criminal proceedings, they can rely on the statutory presumption of malicious intention. If a statutory presumption is not used by the High Courts in quashing petitions, then an accused could bypass the statutory presumption concerning their malicious intention by approaching the High Courts directly , which would make the legislative presumption redundant (¶187). However, the statutory presumption may be ignored where no foundational facts have been established by the state (¶188).Scope of Section 67B of the IT ActThe Supreme Court held that Section 67B not only punishes the electronic dissemination of CESAM but also the creation, possession, propagation and consumption of such material as-well as the different types of direct and indirect acts of online sexual denigration and exploitation of children (¶151).Role of Intermediaries under Section 79 of the IT ActThe Supreme Court held that Section 79 of the IT Act, which provides online intermediaries with qualified immunity from hosting CSEAM uploaded by its users, cannot be invoked unless the intermediaries both remove the content and report the unlawful material to the concerned police units under the POCSO Act (¶¶255-256).Discontinuation of the expression “Child Pornography”The Supreme Court held that instead of the expression ‘child pornography’, the expression “child sexual exploitation and abuse material"" must be used because it reflects the reality of the crime more accurately and emphasises the exploitation and abuse of the child by highlighting the criminal nature of the act and the need for a serious and robust response (¶¶227-228).Suggestions to the Union of India:The Supreme Court suggested the Union Government bring an amendment to the POCSO Act to replace the expression ‘child pornography’ with ‘child sexual exploitation and abuse material” so that the true nature of the offence can be reflected more accurately. In the meantime, the Court suggested bringing an ordinance for this change (¶260).The Court also requested the Union Government to amend Section 15 subsection (1) of the POCSO Act to make it convenient for the general public to report, by way of an online portal, any instance of storage or possession of CSEAM to the authorities (¶260 ix).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

14,13-09-2024,ARVIND KEJRIWAL vs CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONCrl.A. No. 3816/2024,Whether the arrest of Mr. Arvind Kejriwal was legal and is he entitled to bail in the CBI case,"ARVIND KEJRIWAL V. CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION2024 INSC 687 (13 September 2024)Justices:  Justice Surya Kant and Justice Ujjal BhuyanQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the arrest of Mr. Arvind Kejriwal by the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) while he was in judicial custody for a separate case by the Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is legal? (ii) Whether Mr. Kejriwal is entitled to bail in the CBI case.Factual Background:  The Delhi Government framed the Excise Policy 2021-2022 for the sale of liquor. In July 2022, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and the Union Home Ministry complained about financial irregularities concerning the policy. An investigation by the CBI led to the registration of a First Information Report (“FIR”) for the offences of criminal conspiracy, falsification of accounts and gratification for an official act (“CBI case”). Based on this FIR, the ED registered a separate case (“ED Case”) into the liquor policy. Mr. Kejriwal who was Chief Minister of Delhi at the time was not initially named in either the CBI or ED case.On 21 March 2024, the ED arrested Mr. Kejriwal in the ED case. On 20 June 2024, the Trial Court granted Mr. Kejriwal bail in the ED case. However, on 21 June 2024, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of this order and Mr. Kejriwal continued to remain in jail.On 24 June 2024, the CBI sought permission from the Trial Court to interrogate Mr. Kejriwal, which was allowed. After the interrogation, the CBI applied to the Trial Court on 25 June 2024 to arrest Mr. Kejriwal, which the Trial Court allowed. On 29 June 2024, the Trial Court remanded Mr. Kejriwal to judicial custody. Meanwhile, on 12 July 2024, the Supreme Court granted bail to Mr. Kejriwal in the ED case.Mr. Kejriwal approached the Delhi High Court challenging his arrest by the CBI and seeking bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) in the CBI case. He argued that provisions of the CrPC regarding arrest had not been followed by the CBI. The Delhi High Court rejected the challenge to his arrest and declined to grant him bail under Section 439 of the CrPC. The High Court granted him the liberty to approach the Trial Court to seek bail. Instead, Mr. Kejriwal appealed the High Court’s decision to uphold his arrest's legality and deny him bail to the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court authored two separate opinions. Both Judges agreed that Mr. Kejriwal should be granted bail. Justice Kant held that the arrest of Mr. Kejriwal when he was in judicial custody in the ED case was not illegal. However, Justice Bhuyan found the CBI’s arrest of Mr. Kejriwal unjustified.Mr. Kejriwal’s bail was made subject to the conditions imposed on him when granting him bail in the ED Case. These conditions were that he would not visit his office or the Delhi Secretariat and he shall not sign official files unless it is required for obtaining approval of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. Reasons for the Decision:  Legality of arrestWhere the police wish to interrogate an accused whose arrest is not required, Section 41A(1) of the CrPC requires the police to issue a notice to them. Justice Kant held there was no violation of Section 41A(1) of the CrPC in Mr. Kejriwal’s  case even though no notice was given to him because, at the time of Mr. Kejriwal’s arrest, he was under judicial custody in the ED case. Justice Kant ruled that Section 41A(1) of the CrPC does not mandate giving notice to an individual already in judicial custody, and the CBI were correct to approach the Trial Court to seek permission to arrest Mr. Kejriwal (¶¶20-21 J. Kant). Justice Kant pointed out that if the CBI had issued a notice to Mr. Kejriwal instead of approaching the Trial Court, this could have led to Mr. Kejriwal’s interrogation and arrest without the knowledge of the Trial Court (¶¶22-23 J. Kant).Section 41A(2) of the CrPC states that an individual who responds to the notice under Section 41A(1) should not be arrested. However, Section 41A(3) of CrPC allows the arrest of an individual if the police officer believes it is necessary and records the reasons for the arrest. Justice Kant found that the CBI had recorded the reasons for arresting Mr. Kejriwal in its arrest memo and application to the Trial Court, namely that Mr. Kejriwal had allegedly given evasive responses to their questioning. As the CBI had recorded its reasons, Section 41A(3) was complied with and the arrest of Mr. Kejriwal was legal (¶¶25-27 J. Kant).Justice Bhuyan took a different view on the necessity and timing of the arrest of Mr. Kejriwal. He observed that for twenty-two months following the registration of the CBI case, the CBI did not feel the need to arrest Mr. Kejriwal and only did so after he was granted bail in the ED Case. This raised the suspicion that the arrest was only to frustrate the bail that he was granted in the ED case (¶¶23, 31 J. Bhuyan). Justice Bhuyan also observed that every effort must be made to remove the perception that the arrest by the CBI was not made in a biased manner (¶32 J. Bhuyan).Justice Bhuyan ruled that the CBI’s reasons for arresting Mr. Kejriwal, that he was not cooperating with the investigation and was evasive in his replies, were insufficient reasons to arrest Mr. Kejriwal (¶24 J. Bhuyan). He ruled that Article 20(3) of the Constitution (right against self-incrimination) entitles an accused person to not give a statement which may result in their arrest or prosecution. An accused has the right to remain silent (¶25 J. Bhuyan).Mr. Kejriwal is entitled to bailThe Supreme Court held that the continued detention of Mr. Kejriwal would violate his personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court also recognised that he has already been granted bail in the ED case on the same set of facts and all the evidence is already with the CBI. Therefore, the Court ruled that he was eligible for bail (¶¶41-42 J. Kant, ¶37 J. Bhuyan ).Justice Bhuyan expressed his reservations regarding the conditions of bail which would make Mr. Kejriwal unable to visit his office but since a Supreme Court bench of the same strength in the ED case had imposed these bail conditions, he did not interfere with them (¶43 J. Bhuyan).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

KAR MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL, KOLKATA AND RELATED ISSUES vs SMW(Crl) No. 2/2024",Urgent need to formulate institutional safety measures for medical professionals following the murder and alleged rape of a doctor in Kolkata.,"IN RE: ALLEGED RAPE AND MURDER INCIDENT OF A TRAINEE DOCTOR IN R.G. KAR MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL, KOLKATA AND RELATED ISSUES V. 2024 INSC 613 (20 August 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Whether the lack of institutional safety measures for doctors and medical professionals in hospitals necessitates the intervention of the Supreme Court. If yes, what measures should the Court pass?Factual Background:  On 9 August 2024, a thirty-one year old postgraduate doctor who was on a thirty-six hour shift at RG Kar Medical College Hospital in Kolkata was murdered and allegedly raped inside the seminar room of the hospital. The incident led to widespread shock and outrage. The name and graphic images of the deceased were widely circulated on social media.Writ petitions were filed in the Calcutta High Court for a court-monitored investigation into the murder case including into the role of the medical college principal and hospital authorities. The parents of the deceased were initially informed that it was a case of suicide, but the police subsequently registered an FIR alleging murder. The Calcutta High Court transferred the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) after concerns were raised about the initial handling of the case by hospital authorities and state police.On the night of 15 August 2024, a large mob vandalized the Emergency Ward at RG Kar Medical College Hospital. Subsequently, the Indian Medical Association called for nationwide twenty-four hour strike by medical service personnel (except emergency services).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court set-up a nine-member National Task Force to create a national protocol for the safety of doctors and medical professionals around the country. The Task Force was required to formulate effective recommendations to address concerns pertaining to safety, working conditions and well-being of medical professionals and other cognate matters. The Task Force’s action plan may be categorized under two heads (I) Preventing violence, including gender-based violence against medical professionals; and (II) Providing an enforceable national protocol for the dignified and safe working conditions for interns, residents, senior residents, doctors, nurses and all medical professionals.The Supreme Court also ordered the CBI to submit a status report by 22 August 2024 on the progress in the investigation. The State of West Bengal was also informed to file a status report by 22 August 2024 on the progress of the investigation on the acts of vandalism which took place at the Hospital in the aftermath of the incident.Reasons for the Decision:  Protection and safety of medical staff who work round the clockThe Supreme Court observed that medical professionals in the performance of their duties have been unfortunate targets of various forms of violence. Hospitals and medical care facilities are open throughout the day and night. Medical professionals, doctors, nurses and paramedic staff, work round the clock. Unrestricted access to every part of healthcare institutions has made healthcare professionals susceptible to violence. Patients of relatives in anguish are quick to attribute untoward outcomes to the negligence of medical professionals. Such allegations are often followed by violence against medical professionals (¶6).Lack of security infrastructureThe Supreme Court highlighted the lack of institutional safety standards in health care establishments. It pointed out that medical professionals who are posted for night-duties are not provided adequate resting spaces. Often, doctors rest in the patients’ room or in available public spaces (¶9(a)). Interns, residents and senior residents are made to perform thirty-six hour shifts in conditions where even basic needs of sanitation, nutrition, hygiene and rest are lacking. There is an absence of uniformity in terms of a standard national protocol (¶9(b)).The Supreme Court also dealt with the issue of lack of security personnel in medical care units and the absence of sufficient toilets for medical personnel. Doctors and nurses who must travel to and from the hospital are not provided transport facilities by the institution (¶9(e)). The Court also stated that there is an absence of properly functioning CCTV cameras to monitor ingress and egress to the hospital and to control access to sensitive areas (¶9(f)).Ingrained patriarchal attitudes and biasesThe Supreme Court noted that women are at particular risk of sexual and non-sexual violence in various settings. Due to ingrained patriarchal attitudes and biases, relatives of patients are more likely to challenge women medical professionals. In addition to this, female medical professionals also face different forms of sexual violence at the workplace by colleagues, seniors and persons in authority (¶7).The Supreme Court stated that the lack of institutional safety norms at medical establishments pertaining to violence including sexual violence against medical professionals is a matter of serious concern (¶7).Equality of opportunity to every working professionalThe Supreme Court held that the steps provided for in its order are not just for protecting doctors. The safety and well-being of all health providers is a matter of national interest. As more and more women join the workforce in cutting edge areas of knowledge and science, the nation has a vital stake in ensuring safe and dignified conditions of work for all (¶7).Prepared by Deepika Maram (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaLink to Judgment (PDF)Judgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

16,20-08-2024,IN RE: RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF ADOLESCENTS vs SMW(C) No. 3/2023,Use of judicial discretion when quashing rape conviction under IPC and POCSO,"IN RE: RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF ADOLESCENTS V. 2024 INSC 614 (20 August 2024)Justices:  Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Ujjal BhuyanQuestion(s):  Whether the High Court of Calcutta was justified in using its discretionary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution read with Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“Cr.P.C’) to set aside the appellant’s conviction for rape under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (“POCSO Act”) and the Indian Penal Code (“IPC”) on the grounds that the individuals were engaged in a romantic relationship. Factual Background:  The mother of a fourteen-year-old girl (victim) filed a missing report on 20 May 2018. It was later found that the victim was living with the twenty-five-year-old man (accused). Despite several requests from her mother, she did not return and subsequently gave birth to a girl child.Based on the complaint filed by the victim’s mother, the accused was convicted by a special judge under Section 6 of the POCSO Act for aggravated penetrative sexual assault resulting in the victim's pregnancy, Section 376(3) and 376(2)(n) of the IPC for rape of a minor and Sections 363 and 366 of the IPC for kidnapping and forcing a woman to marriage. The special judge sentenced the accused to twenty years of rigorous imprisonment.The conviction was appealed to the Calcutta High Court, contending that the relationship with the minor victim was consensual and she remains under the appellant’s care to date. The High Court, on 18 October 2023, overturned the appellant’s conviction on the charges of kidnapping and enticement on the finding that the victim had left her home on her own will and there was no force or compulsion by the appellant. Given the age of the victim, the offence under Section 6 of the POCSO Act was established. However, the High Court used its discretionary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution read with Section 482 of the Cr.P.C to set aside the POCSO conviction and the conviction of rape under Section 376(3) and 376(2)(n) of the IPC. It observed that the appellant had to be released as there existed a non-exploitative consensual sexual relationship between the two individuals, and the victim was supported by the appellant.Further, the Calcutta High Court stated that there has been an increase in consensual sex among teenagers attributed to peer pressure, the influence of social media, the easy availability of pornographic materials, and the free mixing with friends of the opposite gender. It advised adolescent girls to control their sexual urges as they would bear the responsibility for their actions.The Supreme Court on finding the remarks of the High Court objectionable and unwarranted, took suo motu cognisance of the matter on 7 December 2023. The State Government also appealed against the acquittal by the High Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court found the accused guilty of the offence of rape under Section 376(3) and 376(2)(n) of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act. However, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s acquittal of the accused on the charges of kidnapping and abduction under the IPC. The judgement was authored by Justice Oka.The Supreme Court observed that consensual relationships cannot be an exception to the POCSO Act, and the High Courts cannot use their discretionary powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash prosecutions in such cases where the guilt of the accused is confirmed, even if a settlement is reached between the accused and the victim.The Supreme Court directed the State Government to constitute a committee consisting of a clinical psychologist and a social scientist to assess the victim’s situation and help her arrive at an informed decision. The Supreme Court directed the Secretaries of all States and Union Territories to ensure compliance with the POCSO Act and laws related to the welfare of minors. Reasons for the Decision:  Consensual sex can be no exception under POCSO ActThe Supreme Court criticised the High Court’s reliance on the concept of a “non-exploitative sexual acts” concerning “older adolescents” in the context of heinous crimes. The Supreme Court observed that neither Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC nor Section 6 of the POCSO Act recognised the idea of a “non-exploitative sexual act” nor made any exception for “older adolescents.” (¶16).The Supreme Court clarified that having sexual relationship with a woman under eighteen years of age amounts to rape. The High Court only has to ascertain whether the offence of rape under Section 376 IPC and Section 6 POCSO Act was made out (¶19). The question of the existence of any romantic relationship with the victim is irrelevant in deciding the matter. Courts must exercise their discretionary powers under Article 226 and Section 482 Cr.P.C in adherence to the law and cannot act in defiance of it (¶19).Misuse of powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and Article 226 of the ConstitutionThe Supreme Court found that the High Court’s decision to set aside the conviction through its plenary powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C and Article 226 of the Constitution was an improper exercise of judicial authority (¶¶21, 23.1). The main object of the POCSO Act is to address the heinous crimes of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children in conformity with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children, 1992 (¶21). The Court noted that in serious offences where the guilt of the accused is established, courts cannot exercise their discretionary powers under section 482 of Cr.P.C to acquit the accused given the gravity of the offence (¶21). The Court observed that even if the parties came for a settlement in serious offences like rape and murder, the High Courts should not cancel the prosecution (¶23.1).Failure of the State to fulfil obligations Under the POCSO Act and Juvenile Justice ActThe Supreme Court observed that the State failed to take due care of the victim in accordance with the law (¶25). The Court noted that the State must protect victims of serious crimes and ensure that they live a dignified and healthy life. These victims should be considered as children in need of care and protection under Section 2(14) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 (“JJ Act”) which provides guidelines for their care and rehabilitation(¶¶28.2, 37).The Child Welfare Committee (“CWC”) established under the JJ Act has to ensure the appropriate rehabilitation and restoration of such victims (¶¶28-29). The State's failure to adequately support and monitor the CWC's activities has led to a lack of proper care and protection for the victim. (¶28.1).The judgment of the Court should be simple and preciseThe Supreme Court found that the impugned judgment contained the personal opinions of the Judges as well as advice directed to the adolescents and the legislature (¶14). It emphasised that an appellate court deciding the conviction of the accused must provide clear findings with reasons on the legality and the adequacy of a sentence(¶13). The judgement should be written in simple language (¶¶13, 14). It should not contain the personal opinions of the judges or incorporate advice to the parties (¶¶14, 17). It found that the Calcutta High Court had incorrectly expressed its personal views and made irrelevant observations instead of focusing on the legal determination of the offences committed (¶¶17-19).Prepared by Adarsh Kumar Agrahari (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

17,14-08-2024,MINERAL AREA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ETC. vs M/S STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA .C.A. No. 4056-4064/1999,Whether the judgment in Mineral Area Development Authority v. M/S Steel Authority of India  should be given prospective effect.,"MINERAL AREA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ETC. V. M/S STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA .2024 INSC 607 (14 August 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice B. V. Nagarathna, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, Justice Satish C. Sharma, Justice Augustine G. MasihQuestion(s):  Should the decision in Mineral Area Development Authority v. M/S Steel Authority of India (2024 INSC 554 ) (“Mines and Minerals ”) apply prospectively (apply only to future transactions)?Factual Background:  On 25 July 2024, a Nine-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in Mines and Minerals. The Court, by an 8:1 majority held: (i) that royalty imposed under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (“MMDR Act”) on mining leases is not a form of tax; (ii) States have power under the Entries 49 and 50 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India to levy taxes on mineral rights and mineral-bearing lands; and (iii) the MMDR Act in its current form does not limit the taxing power of the States. In doing so, the majority overruled a Seven-Judge Bench decision in India Cement Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu (1989 INSC 322) (“India Cement”) which had held that royalty under the MMDR Act is a tax, and States cannot impose taxes on mineral rights because the subject-matter is covered by the Union Government’s MMDR Act.Once the judgment in Mines and Minerals was delivered, the assessees (corporations who are liable to pay the taxes imposed by various states) argued that the Mines and Minerals decision should only apply prospectively i.e., they should only be required to pay the State taxes on mineral rights and mineral bearing lands from the date of the judgment (25 July 2024).Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the Mines and Minerals decision would apply retrospectively, and the States can recover past tax dues. However, no dues could be recovered for the period before 1 April 2005. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud. Since Justice Nagrathna had already delivered a dissenting judgment in Mines and Minerals where she held that royalty is a tax and MMDR Act limits the taxing powers of States, she did not author an opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  The Supreme Court observed that the doctrine of prospective overruling (when a declaration of law by the Supreme Court is made applicable on and from the date of the judgment) has been previously recognised and applied by the Supreme Court. The Court has relied on prospective overruling where the Supreme Court’s new declaration of law, by overruling a judgment, results in the invalidation of legislation that would have been valid under the old declaration of law (the overruled judgment). This is done primarily to protect the rights and obligations that have crystallised under the old declaration of law (¶14). For example, if the Supreme Court overruled a judgment that resulted in a taxation statute being struck down with retrospective effect, the State would be liable to refund all amounts collected under the now invalid legislation (¶14). Therefore, in such cases the Court may make the decision apply prospectively. However, where the Court upholds taxation statutes, as in the case of Mines and Minerals, the Court does not make such decisions apply prospectively (¶15).The Supreme Court observed that prior to Mines and Minerals there had been legal uncertainty due to the conflicting in India Cements and State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004 INSC 34) (“Kesoram Industries”). The former judgment had denied States’ power to tax mineral bearing lands while the latter had upheld it. Therefore, if Mines and Minerals was to be given a prospective application, then the validity of all State laws taxing mineral bearing lands enacted prior to Mines and Minerals will have to be tested (¶17).Further, the Supreme Court observed that prior to the decision in Mines and Minerals, the decision in India Cements had held that States do not have a right to tax mineral bearing lands. Thus, if the Mines and Minerals decision was given prospective effect, the validity of State laws taxing mineral bearing lands would have to be tested against the law laid down in India Cements, and thus may be invalidated (¶17). This would result in laws enacted by elected legislatures exercising the sovereign power of taxation being struck down based on a position of law that had since been overruled in Mines and Minerals (¶19).No recovery of the tax dues prior to 1 April 2005The Supreme Court regognised the fact that many states enacted taxing legislations based on the decision in Kesoram Industries which was delivered on 1 April 2005. Therefore, to reconcile the financial interests of the States and the assessees, the Court prevented the States from demanding tax dues relating to mineral bearing lands before Kesoram Industries i.e., before 1 April 2005 (¶20). Prior to Kesoram Industries, the position of law in India Cement prevented States from taxing mineral bearing lands.The Supreme Court considered the long pendency of the case before the Supreme Court and therefore waived the requirement that the assessees pay interests on their dues (which were in the thousands of crores) prior to the date of the judgement in Mines and Minerals (¶22). The Court also ruled that the payment of the dues could be made in instalments over a period of twelve years starting from 1 April 2026 (¶25b).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

18,09-08-2024,MANISH SISODIA vs DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENTCrl.A. No. 3295/2024,Whether Manish Sisodia is entitled to bail due to prolonged incarceration and delay in trial,"MANISH SISODIA V. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT2024 INSC 595 (9 August 2024)Justices:  Justice Bhushan R Gavai and Justice Kalpathy V Viswanathan.Question(s):  Whether the Appellant, Mr. Manish Sisodia, is entitled to bail under Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”) due to his prolonged incarceration and the delay in the conduct of his trial.Factual Background:  The Appellant (Manish Sisodia, former Deputy Chief Minister and Excise Minister of Delhi) was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) and the Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) on 26 February 2023 and 9 March 2023 respectively, in connection with an investigation into the Delhi Liquor Excise Policy 2021-22 (“Excise Policy”).The CBI filed two chargesheets which charged the Appellant for offences under Sections 201 (disappearing evidence) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”) and Sections 7, 7A, 8 and 12 (taking and offering a bribe) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (“PCA”). The ED filed a criminal complaint accusing the Appellant of money laundering under the PMLA.The crux of the allegations was that the Appellant had abused his authority as a public servant by formulating a new Excise Policy for Delhi which favoured certain wholesale distributors in return for bribes and kickbacks to the Appellant and his associates. It was contended by the CBI and ED that these bribes amounted to around Rupees One Hundred Crores, which was laundered and used by the Appellant to support his political party.The Delhi High Court rejected the Appellant’s bail application. On appeal, the Supreme Court on 30 October 2023 rejected the bail application on merits but granted him the liberty to file a second bail application before the trial court if the trial could not be concluded within six to eight months.The Appellant filed a second bail application before the trial court which was rejected. The Delhi High Court also refused to grant the Appellant bail on 21 May 2024. Aggrieved by this order, the Appellant approached the Supreme Court. On 4 June 2024, the Supreme Court noted the Solicitor General’s submission that the eight-month period set by the Court in October 2023 had not elapsed and allowed the Appellant to reapply for bail after the charge sheet was filed. After the charge sheet was filed, the Appellant again approached the Supreme Court for bail. The ED objected to the Appellant’s bail application, arguing that the Appellant should apply for bail to the trial court afresh.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court allowed the appeal and directed the Appellant to be released on bail. The bail was granted subject to the following conditions: (i) furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- with two sureties of the like amount; (ii) surrendering passport with the Special Court; (iii) regular reporting to investigation officers; and (iv) the Appellant must not attempt to influence the witnesses or tamper with the evidence. The judgement was authored by Justice Gavai.Reasons for the Decision:  The second bail application before the Supreme Court is maintainableThe Supreme Court observed that in its order of 30 October 2024, it had permitted the Appellant to file a fresh bail application if there was a prolonged delay in the conduct of his trial (¶29). The Court rejected the prosecution’s argument that the Appellant’s fresh bail application should be before the trial court. The Court held that relegating the Appellant back to the trial court would be unjust and is not a strict procedural requirement as the trial court has already heard and decided the Appellant’s case (¶¶34-35). The Court emphasised that in matters pertaining to the right to life and liberty, a person cannot be made to run from pillar to post (¶33). Thus, the Court found the Appellant did not have to approach the trial court and his bail plea could be decided by the Supreme Court now that the charge sheet had been filed (¶35).The Appellant is entitled to bail under Section 45 of the PMLAThe Supreme Court held that every person charged with an offence was entitled to a speedy trial and the Appellant had been denied a speedy trial (¶¶37, 49).The Supreme Court did not disagree with the decisions of the special judge and the Delhi High Court on the merits of the criminal case (¶44). But the Supreme Court held that the lower courts had ignored its observations that a delay in the trial and long incarceration should also be factored into any bail analysis under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. and Section 45 of the PMLA (¶¶37, 44).The Supreme Court noted that the trial was yet to commence and involves the examination of 493 witnesses and thousands of pages of documentary evidence, and was thus far from concluding in the near future (¶54). As the trial had proceeded in a very slow manner, the Appellant was entitled to bail (¶43). The Court also observed that bail should not be withheld as a punishment (¶53).Prepared by Prashant Sharma (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

19,05-08-2024,GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI vs OFFICE OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF DELHIW.P.(C) No. 348/2023,Whether the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is bound by the aid and advice of the elected Delhi Government when nominating members of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi,"GOVERNMENT OF NCT OF DELHI V. OFFICE OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF DELHI2024 INSC 578 (5 August 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Pamidighantam S. Narasimha, Justice Jamshed B. PardiwalaQuestion(s):  Whether the Lieutenant Governor (“LG”) of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (“NCTD”) is bound by the aid and advice of the elected Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (“Delhi Government”) when nominating members to the Delhi Municipal Corporation under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 (“DMC Act”).Factual Background:  The Delhi Municipal Corporation consists of two hundred and sixty councillors. Two hundred and fifty councillors are directly elected from the wards. However, Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the DMC Act states that the LG of Delhi shall nominate ten persons with special knowledge in municipal administration to the DMC.Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution states that the Delhi Government, through its Council of Ministers, will aid and advise the LG on matters where the Legislative Assembly of Delhi has the power to make laws. In 2018, a Constitution Bench (Five judges) of the Supreme Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India (2018 INSC 577) (“2018 NCT of Delhi”) ruled that the LG is bound by the aid and advice of the Delhi Government through its Council of Ministers. However, Article 239AA(4) also provides an exception to this rule where the LG is, by or under any law, required to act in his discretion.On 4 December 2022, the elections of the Delhi Municipal Corporation were held and candidates of the Aam Aadmi Party won in 134 out of 250 wards while candidates of the Bhartiya Janta Party won in 104 wards. On 3 January 2023, the LG nominated ten persons to the Municipal Corporation.The Delhi Government filed a Writ Petition to the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging the legality of the nominations and sought a direction that the LG only nominate members selected by the Delhi Government.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the LG is not bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the Delhi Government when nominating members to the MCD under Section 3(3)(b)(i) of the MCD Act. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Narasimha. Reasons for the Decision:  Consequences of Parliament enacting DMC ActThe Supreme Court referred to the Constitution Bench (Five Judge) decisions in the 2018 NCT of Delhi and Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India (2023 INSC 517). In those cases, the Supreme Court had held that ordinarily the Delhi Government and the Delhi Legislative Assembly have executive and legislative powers on all matters in List II (State List) and List III (Concurrent List), except for Entries 1, 2 and 18 which are reserved for Parliament due to the fact that Delhi is the national capital. However, if Parliament makes a law in relation to any subject in List II (State list) or List III (Concurrent list), the executive and legislative power of the Delhi Government shall then be limited by the law enacted by Parliament (¶¶15, 22). The Supreme Court found that the DMC Act is a law made by the Parliament and relates to Entry 5 of List II (State List) which deals with the local government i.e. municipal corporation (¶¶18-20). Thus, once Parliament has enacted this law, the power of the Delhi Government concerning the DMC is restricted to the extent set out in the DMC Act.LG not bound by Aid and Advice of the Council of Ministers when nominating individuals under DMC ActThe Supreme Court held that in Delhi, the position of the LG under Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution is different from that of a Governor in a State under Article 163 of the Constitution. The Governor of a State must act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the elected State Government except where the Constitution specifically requires the Governor to exercise discretion. However, under Article 239AA(4) the LG can act discretionarily when required by any law (¶21).The Supreme Court distinguished the nature of the powers of the LG and the Delhi Government under the DMC Act. It observed that the LG of Delhi had been given powers to nominate experts and constitute the finance commission, while the Delhi Government had been given powers to make bye laws and conduct recruitment to the Municipal Corporation (¶¶32-33). Therefore, it ruled that the DMC Act is a law made by Parliament which requires the LG to exercise the power of nomination as a statutory duty and not as part of the LG’s powers as executive head of the NCTD (¶39). Further, the DMC Act satisfies the exception provided under Article 239AA(4) which states that where a law requires the LG to act in his discretion, he is not bound by the aid and advice of the Delhi Government and its Council of Ministers (¶37).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

20,01-08-2024,THE STATE OF PUNJAB vs DAVINDER SINGHC.A. No. 2317/2011,States' power to sub-classify Scheduled Castes for providing reservation,"THE STATE OF PUNJAB V. DAVINDER SINGH2024 INSC 562 (1 August 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Bela M. Trivedi, Justice Pankaj Mithal, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Satish C. SharmaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (“SCs”) for providing reservation is allowed under the Constitution of India. (ii) Whether the states have the power under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution to sub-classify SCs.Factual Background:  Article 341(1) of the Constitution of India grants the President the power to notify the castes, races or tribes which shall be deemed to be SCs in a State or a Union Territory. Article 341(2) states that Parliament can include or exclude any caste, race, or tribe from the list of SCs in the President’s notification. Various laws and schemes provide reservations in public employment to individuals from SCs.Section 4(5) of the Punjab Act provided that fifty percent of the vacancies of the SC reservation shall be offered on first preference to Balmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs amongst the SCs. On 29 March 2010, the High Court of Punjab declared Section 4(5) of the Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act 2006 (“Punjab Act”) unconstitutional by relying on EV Chinnaiah v. State of Andhra Pradesh (2004 INSC 644) (“Chinnaiah”).In Chinnaiah, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court (Five Judges) held that sub-classification amongst SCs by states is unconstitutional because: (i) SCs constitute a homogeneous class; (ii) sub-classifying them would amount to ‘tinkering’ with the Presidential list under Article 341 of the Constitution, which only Parliament can do; and (iii) the rationale of the Nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1996 INSC 1273) (“Indra Sawhney”), which permitted sub-classification of the Other Backward Classes (“OBCs”), does not apply to SCs.On 20 August 2014, a Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court adjudicating the validity of the Punjab Act referred the correctness of Chinnaiah for consideration by a larger Bench. On 27 August 2020, in the State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh (2020 INSC 512) a Constitution Bench (Five Judges) held that the judgment in Chinnaiah requires reconsideration by a larger Bench of Seven-Judges. Several appeals which challenged similar sub-classifications made in reservation policies of the States of Haryana and Tamil Nadu were also tagged with the challenge to the Punjab Act matter. A Seven-Judges Bench was constituted.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Seven-Judge Bench, by a 6:1 majority, held that it was permissible for states to sub-classify SCs when providing reservations. Chief Justice Chandrachud authored a plurality opinion for himself and Justice Misra. Justice Gavai, Justice Mittal, Justice Nath and Justice Sharma each authored separate concurring opinions. Justice Trivedi wrote a dissenting judgment which found sub-classification to be impermissible under the Constitution.Reasons for the Decision:  Sub-classification permitted by the Indra Sawhney decisionThe majority held that the judgment of the Nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney did not create any bar on sub-classification of SCs because sub-classification of SCs was not an issue in that case (¶¶98-100 J. Chandrachud, ¶¶248-249 J. Gavai, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). Further, the majority ruled that Indra Sawhney in fact utilised the principle of sub-classification (in the context of OBCs) to ensure meaningful and substantive equality was achieved where the various constituents within a caste group were not comparable (¶102 J. Chandrachud, ¶¶253, 260 J. Gavai, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).Justice Trivedi’s dissenting opinion found that the Court in Indra Sawhney specifically excluded SCs from the scope of its judgment, and thus the decision could not be interpreted as permitting sub-classification (¶¶70-71 J. Trivedi).SCs under Article 341 do not constitute a homogeneous classThe majority traced the observations in Chinnaiah that SCs are a homogenous class to an earlier decision in State of Kerala v. N. M. Thomas (1975 INSC 224) (“N.M. Thomas”). The majority observed that N.M. Thomas merely observed that SCs once notified by the President cumulatively constituted a distinct “class” (vis-a-vis the general category individuals). However, N.M. Thomas did not say that SCs are a homogenous class which can not be further sub-classified (¶114 J. Chandrachud, ¶261 J. Gavai, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).The majority observed that Article 341 states that once a caste is notified as an SC by the President, such a caste shall be “deemed” to be an SC. (¶110 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). The inclusion of a caste within the SC category is only to demarcate them from other castes which are not included in the category (¶112 J. Chandrachud). This inclusion does not automatically lead to the formation of a uniform and internally homogenous class which cannot be further classified (¶112 J. Chandrachud, ¶261 J. Gavai, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). Inclusion does not mean the existence or non-existence of internal differences among the SCs (¶¶110, 112 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). It only means that each of the groups that are included in the list will receive the benefits that the Constitution provides to the SCs as a class (¶112 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).State legislature has the power of sub-classification under Article 15 and 16The majority observed that Article 341(2) grants Parliament the power to include or exclude groups from the President’s list. This is the power that has been reserved for Parliament and denied to the States. A State Legislature cannot add or remove groups from the President’s List of SCs. However, sub-classification within the SCs for reservation does not include or exclude any caste or group from the President’s List of SCs under Article 341 (¶123 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). Sub-classification does not lead to exclusion of any caste which is already in the President’s List. Therefore, as long as a State that does not include communities not in the President’s list of SCs or exclude communities that the President has designated as SCs, the State does not violate Article 341(2) when sub-classifying (¶188 J. Chandrachud, ¶¶258-260 J. Gavai, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).The majority held that historical evidence confirms that inequality exists within the SCs. Therefore, there is an intelligible way to differentiate between various castes within the SCs (¶142 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). The majority held that if the SCs are not similarly situated then states can not be prevented under Articles 15, 16 and 341 from applying the principle of sub-classification amongst the SCs.Justice Trivedi’s dissenting opinion ruled that although various castes had experienced differing levels of historical discrimination, once they were included in the Presidential List under Article 341, they became a homogeneous group (¶79(v) J. Trivedi). As a result, any form of sub-classification within this group was not permissible (¶79(vi) J. Trivedi). She also concluded that the states lacked the legislative authority to create such sub-classifications, as neither the State List nor the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule, which lays out the State’s lawmaking powers granted them the power to do so (¶79(vi) J. Trivedi).Criteria for the sub classificationThe majority found that the purpose of the reservation clause in the Article 16(4) of the Constitution is to remedy the inadequate representation in public services of certain “classes” which have been inadequately represented because of their backwardness. The question is not whether certain sections of society are a numerical minority in the state administration, but whether groups are inadequately represented because of their backwardness. Further, meaningful representation would not be fulfilled by SCs occupying numerous lower grade posts, but must be assessed across all posts, including senior posts (¶¶166-172 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).The majority held that the states can identify inter-se backwardness amongst SCs through empirical data based on inadequacy of effective representation. However, it must be proved that inadequacy of effective representation of a caste is because of its social backwardness. The State must prove that the group/caste carved out from the larger group of SCs is more disadvantaged and inadequately represented (¶¶175-176 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath). The decision of the state for sub-classification would be subject to judicial review (¶190 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).The majority cautioned the states that they can not adopt a policy of reservation which would allocate seats separately for each caste. It reasoned that this is because the social backwardness suffered by each caste is not so distinct to give reserved seats to each caste separately. It ruled that two casts will have to be grouped together if their social backwardness is comparable (¶195 J. Chandrachud, ¶9 J. Mithal, ¶1 J. Sharma, ¶1 J. Nath).Applicability of creamy layer principle to the SCsA majority of the Court held that certain castes have been reaping benefits of reservation more than others. Therefore, states must evolve a policy to exclude the creamy layer of the SC/ST groups from the benefit of reservation. It also held that the creamy layer principle also applies to SCs. However, the criteria should be different from that which is used for the OBC reservation (¶¶294-295 J. Gavai, ¶83 J. Mithal, ¶2 J. Nath, ¶2 J. Sharma).However, Justice Bela Trivedi in her dissenting opinion stated that the SC/ST groups are already categorized as a 'backward class of citizens’ by the President’s notification. Consequently, the concept of excluding the creamy layer cannot be applied to them (¶¶70-71 J. Trivedi).Dissenting: Current Referral lacks sufficient reasoningJustice Trivedi in her dissenting opinion ruled that the Three-Judge Bench’s decision to refer Chinnaiah to a larger Bench was inappropriate and not in consonance with the doctrines of precedent and judicial discipline (¶25 J. Trivedi). She further held that the referral lacked sufficient justification for doubting the reasoning in Chinnaiah (¶25 J. Trivedi).Prepared by Shambhavi Gupta & Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

21,30-07-2024,GAURAV KUMAR vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 352/2023,Whether State Bar Councils can charge a higher enrollment fees than set out in the Advocates Act.,"GAURAV KUMAR V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 558 (30 July 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice Dr. Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud and Justice Jamshed B. PardiwalaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the State Bar Councils (“SBCs”) are entitled to charge enrolment fees beyond the fee prescribed by Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, 1961, when admitting law graduates to the State rolls. (ii) Whether payment of other miscellaneous fees can be made a precondition for enrolment. Factual Background:  The Advocates Act, 1961 (“Advocates Act”) outlines the process for admitting law graduates onto the state advocate rolls. Being enrolled with the state bar is a prerequisite to practise in Court. The SBCs collect enrolment fees from law graduates seeking to practise law in any court across India. Additionally, the Act specifies the roles and responsibilities of the Bar Council of India (“BCI”) and SBCs.The Petitioner filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court, under Article 32 of the Constitution, challenging the high enrolment fees charged by SBCs. According to Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, the prescribed enrolment fees to be admitted to the State Roll is six hundred rupees to the SBC and one hundred and fifty rupees to the BCI, along with stamp duty. For Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe candidates, the fees are set at one hundred rupees to the SBC and twenty-five rupees to the BCI.The Petitioner contended that SBCs charge high enrolment fees ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000 from law graduates, in violation of the prescribed fees provided under the Advocates Act. Additionally, these fees vary significantly across different states. The SBCs justified these additional charges as necessary to cover miscellaneous expenses, including contributions to library funds, administrative fees, training fees, identity card fees, welfare funds, processing fees, and certificate fees.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) held that SBCs cannot charge enrolment fees beyond the fees set out in Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act and charging of such exorbitant fees is violative of right to equality under Article 14 and right to practise any profession under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. The Court held that SBCs and Bar Council of India cannot demand additional payment of fees other than the enrolment fees and stamp duty set out in the Advocates Act. The Court pronounced its judgment with prospective effect, clarifying that SBCs are not required to refund excess enrolment fees collected from the applicants before the date of judgment. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud. Reasons for the Decision:  High enrolment fees violate the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of IndiaThe Supreme Court observed that the burden of payment of enrolment fees and other miscellaneous fees imposed by the SBCs falls equally on all persons seeking enrolment. However, it unequally impacts individuals with limited economic resources. Thus, the high fees perpetuates structural discrimination against persons from marginalised and economically weaker sections of the society (¶84). Therefore, levying high fees and additional payment requirements violates individuals’ right to equality (¶90).The Supreme Court also observed that the purpose of the Advocates Act is to create an inclusive Bar. The BCI and SBCs are entrusted with the responsibility to ensure greater representation of persons from marginalised communities in the legal profession ((¶91).Charges other than the enrolment fee cannot be a valid pre-conditionThe Supreme Court held that admission on the roll of advocates is a prerequisite to practise law in India (¶79). The Advocates Act provides comprehensive legislation for the collection of fees paid by advocates for their enrolment in the state rolls to practise law in their respective states (¶75). Therefore, the SBCs and BCI cannot demand payment of any miscellaneous fees other than the stipulated enrolment fees set out in Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act as a precondition to enrolment (¶79).Right to practise profession, trade and occupation under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of IndiaThe Supreme Court held that the right to practise law is not only a statutory right but also a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India (¶95). Any restriction on fundamental rights beyond reasonable restriction under Article 19(6) of the Constitution of India is unconstitutional (¶95).In the present case, the Court observed that firstly, the power of the authority to impose restrictions on profession, trade and occupation under Article 19(2) of the Constitution is not absolute and must be exercised in a reasonable manner (¶101). Secondly, any fees or licence levied by the authorities must be levied on the basis of the authority of law (¶101). Thirdly, delegated legislation which is contrary to or beyond the scope of the legislative policy laid down by the parent legislation places an unreasonable restriction in violation of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution (¶101).The Court concluded that the charging of such excessive enrolment fees is without any authority of law, as it is not sanctioned by the Advocates Act. In light of the explicit legislative policy under Section 24(1)(f) of the Advocates Act, there is no justifiable reason for the SBCs to charge such exorbitant fees. SBCs cannot be granted unrestricted authority to charge such fees. Furthermore, such an excessive fee imposes significant financial hardships on young law graduates, particularly those from marginalised communities, thereby violating their rights under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution (¶102).Prepared by Prashant Sharma (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India Judgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

22,25-07-2024,MINERAL AREA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ETC. vs M/S STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA .C.A. No. 4056-4064/1999,Whether states have the power to tax mineral rights and mine bearing lands and whether royalty on mining leases is a tax.,"MINERAL AREA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY ETC. V. M/S STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA .2024 INSC 554 (25 July 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Hrishikesh Roy, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice B. V. Nagarathna, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, Justice Satish C. Sharma, Justice Augustine G. MasihQuestion(s):  (i) What is the scope of Entry 50 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule (the power of states to tax mineral rights subject to Parliamentary legislation)? (ii) Under Entry 54 of the Union List, what limitations can Parliament impose on the power of States to tax mining rights and mineral bearing lands? (iii) Whether charging royalty on mining leases is a form of tax. (iv) Whether the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (“MMDR Act”) limits the states’ power to tax mining rights and mineral bearing lands. (iv) Whether a state’s power to tax land under Entry 49 includes the power to tax mineral bearing land, and if yes, whether mineral produce could be used as a measure of tax.Factual Background:  List I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the subjects on which the Union Government has the power to legislate, while List II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule provides the subjects on which the states are empowered to legislate. Both states, under Entry 23 of List II, and the Union Government, under Entry 54 of List I, have the power to regulate mines and mineral development. However, the states’ power to regulate under Entry 23 is subject to Entry 54 of the Union List, to the extent that Parliament has passed a law stating that the Union Government’s regulation is in the public interest. Separately, Entry 50 of List II grants states the power to tax mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament.Section 9 of the MMDR Act states that the holder of a mining lease shall pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed from the leased area.In an order passed by the Supreme Court on 30 March 2011, the Court found a divergence of views between India Cement Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu (1989 INSC 322) (“India Cement”) and State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. (2004 INSC 34) (“Kesoram Industries”). The Seven Judge Bench in India Cement held that the royalty charged on mining leases is a tax and state legislatures lack competence to levy taxes on mineral rights because mineral rights are covered by the MMDR Act (a legislation by Parliament under Entry 54). Later in Kesoram Industries, a Constitution Bench (five judges) held that the decision in India Cement was based on an inadvertent typographical error and stated that royalty is not a tax.After the decision in Kesoram Industries, several states imposed taxes on mineral bearing lands. These laws were challenged before various High Courts on the ground that states lack the legislative competence to tax mining and mineral bearing lands, and such laws were in violation of India Cement. In one such challenge, the Patna High Court struck down the Bihar Coal Mining Area Development Authority (Amendment) Act 1992 and the Bihar Mineral Area Development Authority (Land Use Tax) Rules 1994. This decision of the High Court of Patna was challenged before the Supreme Court, which constituted a Nine-Judge Bench to resolve the questions surrounding the states’ power to tax mines and minerals, and the correctness of Kesoram Industries.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Nine Judge Bench, by a 8:1 majority, held that royalty on mining leases can not be considered as a tax. The majority also ruled that states’ have the power to tax mining rights and mineral bearing lands under Entry 50 of List II and this power is not limited by the MMDR Act. However, Parliament has the power under Entry 54 of the Union List to limit the taxing power of the states. Chief Justice Chandrachud authored the majority judgment. Justice Nagrathna wrote a dissenting judgment which found that royalty is a form of tax, and the MMDR Act limits the taxing power of the states.Reasons for the Decision:  Royalty is not a taxThe majority held that royalty is a payment which flows from a statutory agreement (a mining lease) between the lessor and the lessee. It signifies payment in return for the right to extract the minerals and is generally determined on the basis of the quantity of the minerals removed (¶98). In contrast, taxation is the compulsory exaction of money by a public authority to fund public expenditure. A tax is imposed without the consent of the taxpayer, and its demand is enforceable without reference to any special benefit granted to the taxpayer (¶104). The majority therefore held that royalty under Section 9 of the MMDR Act does not fulfil the characteristics of tax (¶¶128,130).Justice Nagrathna, in her dissenting opinion, referred to the test for what constitutes a tax in Govind Saran Ganga Saran v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, (1985 INSC 107). The case sets out four components of a tax: (i) the character of imposition (ii) a clear indication of the person on whom the levy is imposed (iii) the rate at which the tax is imposed (iv) the value to which the rate is applied for computing the tax liability. She found that royalties paid under Section 9 of the MMDR Act satisfied this test, and Section 9 must therefore be understood as a taxation provision. She ruled that royalty on mining leases under Section 9 is therefore in the nature of a tax (¶10.10)Justice Nagrathna in her dissent also held that Kesoram Industries was wrongly decided because it’s re-interpretation of the law was premised on a perceived “typographical error” in paragraph 34 of India Cement rather than by reference to the overall reasoning of the Seven-Judge Bench (¶¶23.11-23.12).Power to tax mineral rights rests with states subject to Parliamentary limitationsThe majority relied on the case of M. P. V. Sundararamier v. The State Of Andhra Pradesh (1958 INSC 17) (“Sundararamier""), which stated that in the Seventh Schedule, the power to tax is listed separately from the general power to regulate (¶¶192, 205). Entry 50 of List II expressly grants states the power to tax mineral rights. In contrast, the Union Government, under Entry 54 of List I, is only granted the general power to regulate (not tax) mines and mineral development (¶197). Thus, the power to tax mineral rights lies with the states. However, because the states’ power to tax under Entry 50 of List II is subject to Parliament’s power to regulate under Entry 54 of List I, Parliament can pass laws to ensure that the taxation of mineral rights does not adversely impact mineral development (¶197).Justice Nagrathna in her dissenting opinion held that Entry 50 of the State List is unique and an exception to Sundararamier, because that case did not consider the scope, ambit, and implications of the rule on Entry 54 of List I and Entry 50 of List II (¶41). Therefore, Justice Nagarathna held that Parliament can, on the strength of Entry 54 of List I read with Section 2 of the MMDR Act (which states that Union has taken control of the regulation of mines and mineral development in the public interest) impose any limitation on the power of the states to tax mineral rights under Entry 50 of List II (¶41).Nature of limitation which Parliament can imposeThe majority found that the Parliament can regulate the taxation powers of states to ensure mineral development. This is because the states’ power to tax under Entry 50 of List II had clearly been made subject to Parliament’s power to regulate for mineral development. This may also include a prohibition on state taxation. Thus, the majority found that Parliament can determine whether and how the taxing power of the states over mineral rights should be limited in order to ensure that it does not impede mineral development.(¶211)Justice Nagrathna agreed with the majority that “any limitations” under Entry 50 of the State List is wide enough to include the imposition of restriction as well as a prohibition by Parliament by law (¶41).MMDR Act does not limit the taxing power of the statesThe majority held that a plain reading of Entry 50 of List II makes it clear that the taxing power of the states is subject to “any limitations” imposed by Parliamentary legislation and not the mere existence of a “law relating to mineral development”(¶222). The majority held that the MMDR Act does not contain any provision limiting the taxing powers of the states (¶¶224-227).Justice Nagrathna in her dissenting opinion held that royalty under Section 9 of the MMDR Act met all the parameters of a tax and hence the provisions regarding collection of royalty under the MMDR Act act as a limitation on the states’ power to tax under Entry 50 of the State List (¶26.7).Mineral produce could be used as a measure of taxThe majority ruled that the power of states to tax land under Entry 49 of List II includes the power to tax mineral bearing lands, and that mineral value or mineral produce could be used as a measure of the tax on land under Entry 49 of State List (¶341). The majority observed that the fact that the State legislature uses mineral produce or royalty as a measure of tax does not overlap with the states’ power under Entry 50 of the State List to tax mineral rights (¶341).Justice Nagrathna in her dissenting opinion found that the word “lands” under Entry 49 of the State List cannot include mineral bearing land (¶33). This is because she had already held that Parliament had the right to tax mines and minerals under Entry 54 and was doing so under the MMDR Act. Thus, granting state legislatures the power to tax mineral bearing lands would result in “double taxation” by two different legislatures (¶34).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

23,23-07-2024,GENE CAMPAIGN . vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 115/2004,Challenge against the approval of hybrid transgenic mustard DMH-11 for environmental release.,"GENE CAMPAIGN . V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 545 (23 July 2024)Justices:  Justice B. V. Nagarathna and Justice Sanjay KarolQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the decision of the Union Government dated 25 October 2022 granting conditional approval for the environmental release of genetically modified Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (“DMH-11”) is in accordance with law. (ii) What specific guidelines should the Supreme Court lay down to ensure the safety of the approval process of hybrid transgenic mustard and other genetically modified (“GM”) crops in the future?Factual Background:  The NGO Gene Campaign filed a petition under Article 32 before the Supreme Court raising concerns regarding the use of GM technology in India. In Gene Union’s submissions, GM technology was being utilised without adequate safeguards and regulatory oversight. Gene Union contended that the Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms, Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells Rules, 1989 (“Genetically Engineered Organisms Rules”) framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 are inadequate to regulate GM crops, not in conformity with the right to health and clean environment under Article 21 of the Constitution, and violate India’s international obligations under the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (“CBD”) and the 2000 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (“CPB”).The Supreme Court, by its order dated 1 May 2006, directed that any field trials concerning GM organisms could be conducted only with the approval of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (“GEAC”). Further, by its order dated 10 May 2012, the Court constituted a Technical Expert Committee (“TEC”) which found herbicide resistant crops unsuitable for Indian agriculture because of the risks posed by such crops to the biodiversity and the sustainability of agriculture. The majority of the TEC recommended a prohibition on such crops and recommended the GEAC to constitute subcommittees composed of experts from various fields of science such as health, agro-economics etc.On 15 September 2015, the Center for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (“CGMCP”) submitted an application to the GEAC seeking approval for the environmental release of GM mustard hybrid DMH-11 along with a biosafety dossier. The environmental release would enable the cultivation of GM crops in open fields beyond greenhouse conditions for seed production and testing.Thereafter, representations were made on behalf of CGMCP and the Department of Biotechnology to the (“MoEF&CC”) seeking environmental release of DMH-11 mustard. On 25 August 2022, during the 146th GEAC meeting, the CGMCP made a detailed presentation on its proposal for environmental release of DMH-11. The GEAC recommended constituting an expert committee to examine the impact of transgenic mustard on honeybees and other pollinators.Based on the report of the Expert Committee, the GEAC, in its 147th meeting on 18 October 2022, recommended the environmental release of DMH-11, which was accepted by the Union Government on 25 October 2022. The approval was conditional with certain safeguards including: the GEAC must establish a post release monitoring committee of experts to make regular visits to the cultivation sites; and CGMCP should provide the GEAC with detailed testing procedure and all seeds of DMH-11 and its hybrids should be appropriately labelled.The approval for the environmental release of DMH-11 mustard was challenged as violative of established environmental principles and the fundamental rights of citizens under Article 14,19 and 21 of the Constitution. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court delivered a split verdict and the case was directed to be placed before a larger bench for further consideration. The Court directed the Union Government frame a National Policy on GM crops in consultation with all stakeholders including representatives from State Governments. Two separate judgments were authored by Justice Nagarathna and Justice Karol.Justice Nagarathna held that the approval granted by the Union Government for environmental release of transgenic mustard DMH-11 should be invalidated, as there was no consideration of the adverse effects of the transgenic crops on human, animal, and plant health. She directed the GEAC to submit a report on whether DMH-11 mustard is a herbicide resistant crop in consultation with all stakeholders, and to make the report public. She further directed the Union Government to ensure that the composition of the GEAC is suitably reformed in accordance with the TEC and Parliamentary Standing Committee reports.Justice Karol held that the question of ban on herbicide resistant crops is a matter of public policy and cannot be invalidated in view of precautionary principle. (This principle stipulates that in case of scientific uncertainty, appropriate actions must be taken to prevent irreversible harm to the environment.) He directed that field trials of DMH-11 shall continue strictly in accordance with the imposed safeguards. He further directed GEAC to conduct independent studies on GM organisms and upload it in its website in a timely manner. The GEAC should consider all environmental factors before granting future approvals and should endeavour to establish specifically designated farms for field testing in collaboration with the Union Government.Reasons for the Decision:  Procedural abnormalities in the approval of DMH-11Justice Nagarathna held that the approval process for DMH-11 was flawed due to the lack of consultation with the states where mustard is grown despite agriculture being a subject of state regulation under the Constitution. The Union Government had acted unilaterally without involving relevant stakeholders (¶42.17 J. Nagarathna). She further observed that the grant of approval by the GEAC is governed by Rule 13 of Genetically Engineered Organisms Rules which does not involve the MoEF&CC in the decision making process. Therefore, the intervention by the Ministry without any authority in the approval process undermines the credibility of the regulatory process (¶42.18 J. Nagarathna). Furthermore, established statutory procedures cannot be replaced by alternative methods not outlined in the law and therefore actions taken outside the legal framework are invalid (¶42.20 J. Nagarathna).Justice Karol noted that the power of the GEAC to grant approvals includes the power to regulate the manner in which the approval is granted (¶25(a)21 J. Karol). In the present case, the GEAC had created an expert committee to review the impact of DMH-11 mustard. The formation of and reliance on sub-committees and expert committees by the GEAC does not amount to the delegation of an essential function since the approval process itself has not been delegated (¶¶25(a)14, 25(a)17 J. Karol). Therefore, he opined that the approval for DMH-11 GM Mustard was well reasoned and in accordance with the Genetically Engineered Organisms Rules (¶25(b)5 J. Karol).Right to safe and healthy environmentJustice Nagarathna observed that the potential risks to public and environmental health are irreversible and cannot be substituted by policy or economic measures (¶43.1 (iii) J. Nagarathna). The failure to publish the biosafety dossier on DMH-11 GM Mustard and ignoring the field studies warnings on the impact on honeybees showed lack of standards against misuse of discretion by the GEAC (¶44.1 J. Nagarathna). This failure to evaluate the potential environmental and health impact of GM crops endangers the health of the future generations (¶44.3 J. Nagarathna). Therefore, Justice Nagarathna held that in the absence of appropriate safeguard measures, the Union Government’s decision to grant approval for DMH-11 violates the right to a safe and healthy environment under Article 21 (¶44.5 J. Nagarathna).Interpretation of the precautionary principleThe precautionary principle stipulates that the State should take proactive steps to prevent the degradation of environment and public health even in the absence of complete scientific certainty where the potential harms are irreversible. Justice Nagarathna observed that the environmental release of transgenic crops may lead to a potential loss of indigenous mustard varieties and can also have a serious impact on other beneficial organisms in our biodiversity (¶46 J. Nagarathna). Justice Nagarathna found that there is an absolute need for the conduct of a detailed and in depth assessment of the risk and consequences before proceeding with any such potentially harmful activity. The absence of such studies is a clear violation of India’s binding obligation under Article 14(1)(b) of the CBD and Article 26 of the CPB (¶46 J. Nagarathna).Justice Karol held that the field trials and lab testing in respect of GM organisms are in line with the development of scientific temper as envisaged in our Constitution along with the precautionary principle (¶40 J. Karol). He observed that the minority report submitted by Dr. Paroda in the TEC, which recommended suitability of GM crops, cannot be disregarded entirely (¶28.10 J. Karol). He rejected the contention that the approval by GEAC suffers from non-application of mind, as it was based on multiple documents and deliberations and not just the comments of the expert committee (¶¶28.13, 29.4, 31(ii)(h) J. Karol). He noted that there exists a presumption in favour of a policy to be made in public interest when it is enacted by a competent authority unless proven to be manifestly arbitrary (¶43 J. Karol).Prepared by Benila B MCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

24,12-07-2024,ARVIND KEJRIWAL vs DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENTCrl.A. No. 2493/2024,Challenging the validity of the arrest of Chief Minister of Delhi,"ARVIND KEJRIWAL V. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT2024 INSC 512 (12 July 2024)Justices:  Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar DattaQuestion(s):  (i) What legal requirements have to be satisfied for an arrest to be lawful under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”)? (ii) Whether the Directorate of Enforcement’s (“ED”) arrest of Mr. Arvind Kejriwal complied with Section 19 of the PMLA.Factual Background:  The Delhi Government framed the Excise Policy 2021 for the sale of liquor in the National Capital Territory. The ED registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (“ECIR”) against several persons alleging that the adoption of this policy led to financial benefits for the accused and a loss of government revenue.The ED summoned the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr.Arvind Kejriwal, as part of its investigation. Mr. Kejriwal did not comply with the summons and was arrested by the ED on 21 March 2024. He challenged his arrest before the Delhi High Court which dismissed his plea on 9 April 2024. On 10 May 2024, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail until 1 June 2024 in light of the Lok Sabha elections 2024.Section 19 of PMLA provides that an authorised officer making the arrest must: (i) have material in their possession which gives them reasons to believe the potential arrestee is guilty of an offence; (ii) write the reasons to believe that the potential arrestee has committed an offence under the PMLA; and (iii) inform the arrested person of the grounds of their arrest.Mr. Kejriwal argued that his arrest was politically motivated and that the ED violated the procedures set out in Section 19 of PMLA during his arrest. He contended that Section 19 permitted arrest only where there was a “necessity to arrest” and the ED had failed to demonstrate the “necessity to arrest” Mr. Kejriwal. The ED contended that Mr.Kejriwal was the key conspirator in framing the Excise Policy in exchange for bribes. It also claimed that Mr. Kejriwal used the proceeds of the crime to fund the Goa election campaign of the Aam Aadmi Party (“AAP”), of which he is the convenor.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (Two-Judges) of the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Mr. Kejriwal while referring the legal questions concerning the validity of his arrest to a larger bench. The larger bench will address the issues related to the need and necessity for arrest under Section 19 of the PMLA. Mr. Kejriwal’s interim bail was subject to the following conditions: (i) furnishing a bail bond worth Rs.50,000 with surety; (ii) not visiting his office or signing official documents without approval; (iii) refraining from commenting on the case; and (iv) avoiding contact with witnesses or access to related official files. The judgment was authored by Justice Khanna.Reasons for the Decision:  The validity of an arrest under Section 19(1) can be challengedThe Supreme Court rejected the argument of the ED that judicial review of arrests under the PMLA will hinder the process of investigation. The legislature has laid out strict preconditions for arresting someone under Section 19 (¶21). The authority deciding whether to arrest is an administrative one, and the error by such authority would lead to a loss of liberty to the arrestee (¶61). Thus, courts must have the power to review the validity of arrests under Section 19(1) of the PMLA (¶21). Courts can examine whether an arrest made complies with all the preconditions in Section 19 and whether all the facts have been considered by the authority making the decision (¶¶21, 61).Scope of review of arrest under Section 19 PMLAThe Supreme Court observed that the judicial review of an arrest under Section 19 PMLA is not a review on the merits of the case (¶¶39, 44). Judicial scrutiny becomes necessary when the reasons recorded for authorising arrest are not clear and lucid. The Courts should only ascertain whether the reasons provided by the ED justify the arrest made and whether the material in possession of the ED supports the ED’s reasons to believe that the arrestee is guilty of the offence (¶39). The Courts should also ensure that the actions of the ED are in accordance with the law. Therefore, the power of review by the courts extends to examining the validity of the ED’s reasons to believe the arrestee is guilty to ensure that the arrest is not arbitrary (¶39).Existence and the validity of the reasons to believeThe Supreme Court observed that the phrase “reasons to believe” would mean that there should be a connection between the reasons for the formation of the belief and the elements on which the belief is formed (¶34). The subjective opinion formed by the authority under Section 19(1) should be based on a fair and objective consideration of the available materials at the time of arrest. The reasons to believe that the arrestee is guilty should be founded on the documents and the oral statements available with the officer (¶29). Courts can review if this opinion is based on relevant facts (¶32). The Court observed that the accused should be furnished with a copy of the ED’s reasons to believe to enable them to meaningfully challenge the arrest (¶36).The Supreme Court observed that while determining the arrest of a person under Section 19 PMLA, the ED must consider all the evidence including any material that absolves the arrestee of guilt. An arrest cannot be made by selectively choosing material to arrive at the belief that the arrestee is guilty (¶¶50, 55-56).There are sufficient reasons to believe the guilt of the accusedThe Supreme Court examined the contents of the ED’s reasons to believe Mr. Kejriwal was guilty (¶48). The ED’s reasons to believe noted that Mr. Kejriwal is responsible both individually, as a key person in formulating the policy, and vicariously as the head of the AAP. Further, he failed to cooperate with multiple summons issued during the investigation process (¶48). The Court found that the ED had clearly recorded their reasons to believe that Mr. Kejriwal was involved in the offence of money laundering (¶49). The Court further noted that Mr. Kejriwal’s arguments against the ED’s reasons to believe are deductions and propositions. The judicial review of the court at the stage of arrest is limited and the court cannot review the merits of the opinion formed by the ED (¶65).Necessity of arrestThe Supreme Court referred to the case of Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014 INSC 463) which recognised the importance of considering the necessity to arrest. An authorised officer making an arrest must show that there is a necessity to arrest the accused. In the present case, Mr. Kejriwal argued that the reasons to believe furnished by the ED did not disclose a necessity to arrest (¶67). The Court referred the question of need and necessity to arrest as a separate ground to challenge arrest under Section 19(1) for consideration by a larger bench (¶84).Whether interim bail should be granted to Mr. KejriwalThe Supreme Court noted that Mr. Kejriwal has undergone incarceration for over ninety days and the legal questions referred to the larger bench require in depth consideration. Recognising that the right to life and liberty is fundamental, the Court released him on interim bail subject to the above mentioned conditions (¶85).Prepared by Rewant Singh (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

25,11-07-2024,MD. RAHIM ALI @ ABDUR RAHIM vs THE STATE OF ASSAMC.A. No. 7332/2024,"Standard for initiating proceedings doubting an individual's nationality under the Foreigners Act, 1946.","MD. RAHIM ALI @ ABDUR RAHIM V. THE STATE OF ASSAM2024 INSC 511 (11 July 2024)Justices:  Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Ahsanuddin AmanullahQuestion(s):  What is the threshold for doubting a person’s nationality under the Foreigners Act, 1946 (“Foreigners Act”)? Factual Background:  In 2006, a case was registered in the Foreigners Tribunal, Nalbari, Assam (“Tribunal”) against the Appellant based on a reference made by the Superintendent of Police of Nalbari. The reference cast doubt on the Appellant’s nationality because on being asked, the Appellant could not produce any documentary evidence to prove his entry into India prior to 1 January 1966. The Appellant appeared before the Tribunal on 18 July 2011 and sought permission to file written submissions, but was ultimately unable to do so because, according to the Appellant, he was suffering from serious health issues.By an ex-parte order (without hearing the Appellant) on 19 March 2012, the Tribunal ruled that the Appellant had failed to discharge his burden under Section 9 of the Foreigners Act. Section 9 requires the person whose citizenship is in doubt to prove that they are not a foreigner.The Appellant appealed to the High Court Guwahati, which affirmed the Tribunal’s order. The Appellant subsequently approached the Supreme Court.On 28 July 2017, the Supreme Court, considering the peculiar nature of the case, directed the Tribunal to decide the nationality of the Appellant after examining the documents the Appellant had produced. Subsequently, the Tribunal again found the Appellant to be a foreigner. The Tribunal’s findings were placed before the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court found that the authorities did not possess any material to question the nationality of the Appellant. It recognised the Appellant as an Indian citizen. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Amanullah.Reasons for the Decision:  Need for a material basis to initiate the proceedingsThe Supreme Court held that the authorities must possess some material or information to suspect that a person is a foreigner. A mere allegation cannot lead to shifting of the burden of proving their Indian nationality onto the accused, unless the accused person is confronted with the allegation coupled with the material backing such allegation (¶35).The Supreme Court also held that in the absence of some material basis or information, it cannot be left to the discretion of the authorities to initiate proceedings to question the citizenship of a person based on hearsay or vague allegations, as such allegations have serious consequences for the person. The Court found that the Tribunal had failed to explain how and from where the allegation relating to the alleged village of origin of the Appellant in Bangladesh came to the knowledge of the authorities nor was any supporting material produced to substantiate the allegation (¶37).The Supreme Court distinguished between the expressions ‘main grounds’ used in the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964 (“Tribunals Order”) and mere ‘allegations’ levelled against the accused. The Tribunals Order requires that the accused be provided with the main grounds on the basis of which they are accused of being a foreigner. The Court held that ‘main grounds’ means the material on which the allegation is founded and the nationality of the accused is doubted (¶¶ 38-39)Strict compliance with the principles of natural justiceThe Supreme Court held that the principles of natural justice, which require both sides to be heard, necessitates that the accused receive a copy of the main grounds (¶39). The information available with the authorities must be communicated to the accused to allow the accused to refute the allegation (¶35).Spelling errors and discrepancy in dates are minorThe Supreme Court found that the evidence in the form of Electoral Rolls presented by the Appellant to show that he and his parents resided in India prior to the cut off date under the Foreigners Act was rejected by the Tribunal only because of mismatches of English spellings and discrepancy in dates. The Court held that these mismatches and discrepancies were minor and common given the ground realities of limited literacy in India(¶¶41-42).Prepared by Osama NoorCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

26,08-07-2024,FRANK VITUS vs NARCOTICS CONTROL BUREAUCrl.A. No. 2814-2815/2024,Whether an accused can be required to share their location on Google Maps as a bail condition.,"FRANK VITUS V. NARCOTICS CONTROL BUREAU2024 INSC 479 (8 July 2024)Justices:  Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Ujjal BhuyanQuestion(s):  (i) Whether requiring an accused to share their location on Google Maps with the Investigating Officer, as a condition for granting bail, violates the right to privacy of the accused. (ii) Whether requiring an accused who is a foreign national to obtain a Certificate of Assurance from their High Commission/Embassy ensuring their presence in India and appearance in court can be imposed as a condition for bail.Factual Background:  The Appellant, a Nigerian national, was being prosecuted under Sections 8, 22, 23, and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (“NDPS Act”) for the production, manufacture, sale, purchase, and use of narcotics/psychotropic substances, as well as the import and export of such substances.After being arrested, the Appellant was granted bail subject to various terms and conditions as per the Supreme Court’s directions in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee Representing Undertrial Prisoners v. Union of India (1994 INSC 456) (“Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee”). In this case, the Supreme Court had issued certain directions for the release of undertrial prisoners in NDPS cases.Aggrieved by the conditions imposed while granting bail, the Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court. The specific conditions the Appellant contested were: (i) the requirement to obtain a certificate of assurance from the High Commission of Nigeria, guaranteeing that the Appellant would not leave India and would appear in Court; (ii) the requirement to drop a PIN on Google Maps to allow the Investigation Officer to track the Appellant’s location.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division bench (two-judges) of the Supreme Court noted that requiring the Appellant to drop a PIN on Google Maps does not allow for any real-time monitoring of the accused. Therefore, the condition is of no aid to the state authorities, does not further the objective of bail and thus ought to be deleted. Further, the Supreme Court held that the requirement to obtain a certificate of assurance from the High Commission was also excessive and more reasonable conditions, such as requiring the accused to surrender the passport and regularly report to the local police station or trial court can be imposed. The judgment was authored by Justice Oka. Reasons for the Decision:  Additional Bail Conditions in the “Interest of Justice”The Supreme Court held that once a case for bail is made out under Section 37 of NDPS Act, the conditions of bail should follow Section 437(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CrPC”). Such conditions may include: (i) the accused attending the court as required; (ii) the accused refraining from committing similar offences; and (iii) not interfering with the investigation by influencing witnesses (¶5). The Court noted that while additional conditions can be imposed “in the interest of justice,” these conditions should not be arbitrary or overly restrictive. They must serve the purpose of preventing interference with the investigation, ensuring the accused does not tamper with evidence, and maintaining their presence at trial (¶7).Condition of Dropping PIN on Google MapsThe Supreme Court found that the requirement for the accused to drop a PIN on Google Maps was redundant and ineffective for tracking purposes. The Court noted that this condition fails to offer real-time tracking and, thus, does not aid the Narcotics Control Bureau in monitoring the accused’s movements (¶10.1). The Court held that imposing such a condition would infringe the accused’s right to privacy under Article 21 by requiring them to share their location, but has no relevance as a condition for bail as it does not facilitate real-time monitoring (¶10.2). The Court also noted that a bail condition which allows the police or investigation agency to track every movement of the accused would violate the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution (¶10.2).Condition of Furnishing a Certificate from the High Commission/EmbassyThe Supreme Court clarified that the requirement to provide a certificate from the High Commission/Embassy of the country to which the accused belongs, as required in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee, was applicable only as a one-time measure for cases pending at the time of the judgment. It is not a blanket condition for all cases involving foreign nationals (¶11.1). If obtaining such a certificate proves impractical or the Embassy fails to issue it within a reasonable time, the court can waive this requirement. The accused cannot be held responsible for delays beyond their control (¶12). Alternative conditions, such as requiring the accused to surrender the passport or regularly reporting to the police, may be imposed instead (¶12).Prepared by Rewant Singh (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

27,15-05-2024,PRABIR PURKAYASTHA vs STATE (NCT OF DELHI)Crl.A. No. 2577/2024,"Challenge to arrest under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and need to inform accused of grounds of arrest in writing.","PRABIR PURKAYASTHA V. STATE (NCT OF DELHI)2024 INSC 414 (15 May 2024)Justices:  Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Sandeep MehtaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether a person arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (“UAPA”) is required to be provided with the grounds of their arrest in writing. (ii) Whether the Appellant’s remand into police custody was legal. Factual Background:  A Special Cell of the Delhi Police conducted raids on the residential and business premises of the Appellant and PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt. Ltd., where the Appellant is a Director. The raids were carried out in connection with a First Information Report (“FIR”) filed under various sections of the UAPA, and the Indian Penal Code. During these raids, numerous documents and digital devices were seized. The Appellant was arrested on 3 October 2023. The Appellant was produced before an Additional Sessions Judge and remanded to seven days of police custody on 4 October 2023. The Appellant challenge to the arrest and remand was rejected by the Delhi High Court on 13 October 2023, leading to the current appeal before the Supreme Court.The Appellant contended that his arrest memo did not include grounds for arrest, and the remand process was conducted without proper legal representation, resulting in an illegal remand order. The Respondent State contended that the arrest followed due process, and there is no constitutional mandate requiring the grounds of arrest to be conveyed in writing under the UAPA.Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Division Bench (Two Judges) of the Supreme Court held that the Appellant’s arrest and remand into police custody were invalid because the grounds for arrest were not communicated in writing before the remand. As charges had now been framed against the Appellant, the Appellant was ordered to be released from custody after furnishing bail as required by the trial court. The judgement of the Court was authored by Justice Sandeep Mehta.Reasons for the Decision:  ‘Grounds of Arrest’ must be communicated in writingThe Supreme Court stated that Article 22(1) of the Constitution (‘Protection against arrest and detention in certain cases’) mandates that the grounds of arrest must be communicated in writing (¶20). The Court noted that the decision in Pankaj Bansal (2023 INSC 866), had held that an individual arrested under Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was entitled to be informed of the grounds of their arrest in writing, and the same principle would apply to cases under the UAPA where the statutory language was the same (¶¶18-20). The Court also rejected the State’s argument that in cases of preventive detention, governed by Article 22(5) of the Constitution, no grounds of detention needed to be communicated to the detenu (¶¶23-30).Distinction Between ‘Reasons’ and ‘Grounds’ of ArrestThe Supreme Court differentiated between ‘reasons for arrest’ and ‘grounds of arrest’ (¶49). The Court observed that ‘reasons for arrest’ are formal and could apply to any accused person (e.g., to ‘investigate the offence’ or to ‘prevent the accused from committing further offences’) (¶49). However, ‘grounds of arrest’ is the detailed information that the Investigating Officer possesses which necessitates the arrest of the particular accused in the particular case (¶49).Procedural Irregularities in RemandIn the present case, the Supreme Court noted that the Appellant’s chosen legal representative was not informed or present during the remand proceedings where the Appellant was produced and sent to police custody. Instead, a remand advocate was appointed despite the Appellant’s chosen lawyer making himself known to the police (¶34). Crucially, a copy of the FIR was shared with the Appellant's lawyer only after the remand order had already been passed (¶33). The Appellant’s lawyer was not informed of the grounds of arrest in writing until after the remand order had been passed (¶35). Further, the Supreme Court found that the arrest memo did not disclose any grounds of arrest (¶¶37-39, 48).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

28,10-05-2024,ARVIND KEJRIWAL vs DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENTCrl.A. No. 2493/2024,Interim bail for the Chief Minister of Delhi.,"ARVIND KEJRIWAL V. DIRECTORATE OF ENFORCEMENT2024 INSC 400 (10 May 2024)Justices:  Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar DattaQuestion(s):  Whether interim bail should be granted to Mr. Arvind Kejriwal?Factual Background:  On 20 July 2022, the Lieutenant Governor of National Capital Territory (“NCT”) of Delhi made a complaint regarding certain financial irregularities concerning the Delhi Excise Policy. Following the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, an investigation by the Centre Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”) led to the registration of First Information Reports. The Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”) registered a complaint on 22 August 2022. The CBI’s investigation implicated Mr. Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of the NCT of Delhi, in an alleged criminal conspiracy and offenses under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (public servants taking gratification for an official act).After its investigation, the ED filed a complaint on 26 November 2022. The CBI also filed a chargesheet. However, charges had not been framed yet. On 21 March 2024, the ED arrested Mr. Kejriwal in pursuance of its investigation. Mr. Kejriwal was remanded into the custody of the ED. The trial court and High Court of Delhi upheld the legality of Mr. Kejriwal’s arrest.Mr. Kejriwal filed an appeal before the Supreme Court of India challenging the legality of his arrest. In view of the lengthy nature of the proceedings and imminent general elections, the Supreme Court also agreed to hear the arguments for the grant of interim bail to Mr. Kejriwal.Decision of the Supreme Court:  A Division Bench (Two-Judges) of the Supreme Court held that Mr. Kejriwal should be released on interim bail till 1 June 2024 on certain terms and conditions. First, he will have to surrender to the investigation authorities on 2 June 2024; second, he must furnish bail bonds to the sum of Rs. 50,000; third, he shall not be allowed to visit the Office of the Chief Minister and the Delhi Secretariat; fourth, he shall not sign official files unless it is required and necessary for obtaining approval of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi; fifth, that he shall not make any comment with regard to his role in the present case; and sixth, he shall not interact with any of the witnesses or have access to any official files connected with the case.Reasons for the Decision:  The Supreme Court noted that it was not possible to pronounce a final judgment on the arguments concerning the legality of arrest immediately (¶7). However, given that the 18th Lok Sabha elections were already underway, the Court decided to consider the issue of interim bail for Mr. Kejriwal for the duration of the elections (¶¶7-8).The Supreme Court observed that the term “interim bail” is not defined anywhere in any law (¶13). However, it has gained legal acceptance and entails the temporary release of an individual under compelling or unique circumstances. It is different from regular bail and is generally pleaded when the accused or convict is not entitled to regular bail (¶¶13-14).The Supreme Court then referred to previous case laws pertaining to the power to grant interim bail (¶¶9-13) and noted that the grant of interim bail is based on the facts of each case (¶14). The Court took note of the ED’s contention that Mr. Kejriwal had failed to appear before the ED in spite of nine notices being issued to him (¶15). However, after considering other factors including the fact that Mr. Kejriwal was the Chief Minister of Delhi and a leader of a national party as well as the fact that he did not have any past criminal record and was not a threat to society, the Court directed that Mr. Kejriwal be released on interim bail (¶15).The Supreme Court also emphasised that the investigation in the case was yet to be completed and the validity of the arrest itself had been challenged and was pending before the Supreme Court (¶15). Further, since the 18th Lok Sabha elections were also taking place, the Court granted interim bail to Mr. Kejriwal (¶15). The Court, however, clearly stated that the grant of interim bail to Mr. Kejriwal was not an expression of its opinion on the merits of the case (¶19).Prepared by Navya Yadav (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

29,01-05-2024,SHARIF AHMAD vs THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH HOME DEPARTMENT SECRETARYCrl.A. No. 2357/2024,"When is a chargesheet complete under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.","SHARIF AHMAD V. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH HOME DEPARTMENT SECRETARY2024 INSC 363 (1 May 2024)Justices:  Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sarasa V. BhattiQuestion(s):  When can a chargesheet be said to be complete so that the Court can take cognizance of the offence under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”)?Factual Background:  The Appellants in this case were involved in a property ownership dispute. An FIR was filed against them under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (breach of trust), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”). The FIR alleged that the Appellants had agreed to sell the property, accepted a partial payment, but failed to complete the registration or return the payment. Subsequently, a chargesheet was filed against them under Sections 406 (breach of trust) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.After the Allahabad High Court dismissed their application to quash the chargesheet and stop the criminal proceedings, the Appellants approached the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court allowed the appeal filed by the Appellants and set aside the chargesheet and criminal proceedings against them. The Court held that in this case there was no evidence of entrustment; the property was not handed over in trust, rather, there was a sale. Therefore, there could be no question of a breach of trust under Section 406 IPC. Additionally, there was no material to show intent to cause alarm, necessary for an offence of criminal intimidation under Section 506 IPC, even if the allegations against the Appellants were to be accepted.The Court further elaborated on the necessary contents of a chargesheet, stating that it is considered complete when it includes sufficient material and evidence for the Court to take cognizance and proceed to trial. The Court further stressed the importance of chargesheets containing detailed facts of the offence and the relevant evidence, as mandated by Section 173(2) of the CrPC.Reasons for the Decision:  Importance of charge sheetThe Supreme Court emphasised the importance of a chargesheet in criminal proceedings. It held that an investigation involves multiple stages: visiting the crime scene by the investigating officer, ascertaining facts, making arrests, collecting evidence, and forming an opinion on whether an offence is made out. The submission of a chargesheet, which is the final step, depends on the opinion of the investigating officer (¶27). Upon completing the investigation, the investigating officer must promptly submit a report with the prescribed details to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence. The report which is presented represents the investigating officer’s conclusion based on the materials collected during the investigation. (¶22). Although the terms “chargesheet” and “final report” are not explicitly used in the CrPC, they are commonly understood as the report filed by the police under Section 173(2) of the CrPC (¶15).The Supreme Court further explained that the submission of the chargesheet under Section 173(2) of the CrPC, cognizance taken under Section 190, the summoning of the accused under Section 204, and the framing of charges under Chapter XVII of the CrPC are closely interrelated. The details in the chargesheet are crucial for the subsequent procedural stages (¶20). The charge sheet is the primary document available to the court at this stage, containing the investigating officer’s reasons for charging the accused. This helps the Magistrate determine if there are sufficient grounds to take cognizance, initiate proceedings, issue notices, and frame charges (¶20).Meaning of “taking cognizance of offence”The Supreme Court also clarified the meaning of “taking cognizance of an offence” in relation to Sections 190 and 204 of the CrPC. It explained that “cognizance” under Section 190 refers to the judicial act of a Court or Magistrate in taking notice of an offence, and deciding to initiate legal proceedings (¶16). This stage requires the magistrate to assess the contents of the complaint or police report to determine if there are sufficient grounds to proceed. More importantly, this evaluation does not involve judging the adequacy of evidence for conviction, which is only decided during the trial stage (¶16).When can a charge sheet be said to be completeThe Supreme Court held that a chargesheet is considered complete under Section 173(2) of CrPC when it includes material and evidence sufficient for the court to take cognizance and proceed to trial. The evidence presented should prima facie establish the offence, if it is proven during trial (¶13). It was held that a chargesheet is deemed complete if the case does not rely exclusively on further (yet to be discovered) evidence, allowing the trial to proceed based on the evidence and material already on record (¶13). The chargesheet need not be overly detailed in its evaluation of evidence, as that is the purpose of the trial (¶23).Further, the Supreme Court held that a complete chargesheet should reflect a thorough investigation into the alleged offence and provide the Magistrate with enough information to decide on the appropriate course of action, whether to take cognizance, issue process, or exercise other available options (¶24). The final report/chargesheet must clearly and precisely outline the alleged contravention of the law (¶28).Lastly, the investigating officer must ensure all columns in the chargesheet are thoroughly completed, clearly indicating which crime was committed by which accused, and listing the available material evidence (¶31). Statements of witnesses and related documents should be included with the list of witnesses. The specific role played by each accused in the crime should be distinctly mentioned for each person involved (¶31).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

30,26-04-2024,ASSOCIATION FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORMS vs ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 434/2023,Challenge to the integrity of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs).,"ASSOCIATION FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORMS V. ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA2024 INSC 341 (26 April 2024)Justices:  Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar DattaQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the current use of Electronic Voting Machines (“EVMs”) ensures the integrity and security of elections. (ii) Whether there is a need for 100% vote-verification through Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (“VVPAT”) to cross-check votes cast through EVMs.Factual Background:  The Association for Democratic Reforms, a non-governmental organisation, filed a petition challenging the reliability of EVMs. The Petitioners argued that either EVMs should be discontinued, and the Court should pass directions to return to the paper-ballot system, or 100% of the VVPAT slips should be counted alongside the electronic tally to ensure transparency.The VVPAT system, linked to EVMs, allows voters to verify their vote through a slip printed with the candidate’s name, symbol, and serial number, visible for seven seconds before it gets cut and deposited into a sealed box. Currently, five randomly chosen polling stations per constituency undergo VVPAT verification, where the electronic count is checked against the printed slips. The petitioners argued this was insufficient, and proposed that the VVPAT printed slip should be given to voters to verify and then placed in a ballot box for counting, or that there should be 100% VVPAT slip verification to ensure votes are accurately recorded and counted.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court rejected the Petitioner’s demand for a complete return to paper ballots or for 100% counting of VVPAT slips. The Court acknowledged the Petitioner’s concerns regarding the transparency and reliability of EVMs but emphasised that the current system, which made the VVPAT slip visible to the voter for seven seconds before being deposited in a sealed box, provides an adequate method for verifying votes. The Court also issued directions to ensure further improvements in the electoral process to enhance voter confidence and the integrity of elections. Justice Khanna authored an opinion, and Justice Datta also wrote a concurring opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  How an EVM worksThe Supreme Court highlighted the procedures and safeguards implemented by the Election Commission of India to uphold the integrity of elections. The EVM system is comprised of three units: the ballot unit, the control unit, and the VVPAT. The ballot unit functions as a keypad with sixteen keys for voters to select their candidate (¶17 J. Khanna). Serial numbers, candidate names, and party symbols are physically pasted on the ballot unit to help voters identify the corresponding key/button (¶17 J. Khanna).The control unit, managed by the polling officer, activates the ballot unit for voting when the ‘BALLOT’ button is pressed. When a voter presses the buttons on the ballot unit, an LED next to the candidate’s button lights up, and the control unit instructs the VVPAT to print a slip (¶17 J. Khanna). This VVPAT slip displays the serial number, candidate name, and symbol, visible through a glass window for seven seconds for voter verification. The slip is then cut from the roll and deposited into the VVPAT compartment. The fall sensor in the VVPAT then sends a confirmation to the control unit, which then records the vote (¶17 J. Khanna).Concerns about EVM manipulation are unfoundedThe Supreme Court noted that approximately ten to fifteen days before polling, symbols are electronically loaded onto the VVPAT using symbol loading units, which involves creating a bitmap file with candidate details and symbols (¶¶30-31 J. Khanna). During this stage, each candidate is assigned a specific button/key on the ballot unit based on alphabetical order and the type of political party, which varies by constituency (¶31 J. Khanna). Until the symbol loading process into the VVPATs is completed, the EVMs remain devoid of any data related to political parties or candidates (¶35 J. Khanna). This process does not alter the firmware programmed in the control unit and ballot unit, which remains neutral towards candidates and political parties (¶36 J. Khanna). Thus, prior to the symbol loading process, the EVM has no data about political parties and one cannot ascertain which button will be allocated to which party (¶35 J. Khanna). Prior to polling, the presiding officer has to demonstrate to the polling agents that no vote has been recorded on the control unit (¶43 J. Khanna). On polling day, rigorous procedural checks include a mock poll, to check that pressing a party’s button results in VVPAT slip for the party, and sealing of EVMs with serialised paper seals, overseen by candidates and security personnel (¶34-38 J. Khanna). Further, the EVM will not accept more than four votes in one minute, preventing booth capture and repeated pressing of the voting button (¶33 J. Khanna).The polled EVM units are sealed and stored in strong rooms in the presence of candidates or their representatives, who are also allowed to put their seals on the lock of the strong room. These rooms are guarded by armed security and monitored with CCTV, ensuring the integrity of the stored EVMs (¶39 J. Khanna). After polling, the Presiding Officer can press the ‘Total’ key to ascertain how many votes were recorded but cannot ascertain the breakup of votes in favour of each party. Only on counting day, in the presence of the candidates or their representatives, is the ‘Result’ key pressed on the control unit to ascertain which party’s button was pressed how many times (¶41 J. Khanna). EVMs are not connected to the internet (¶41 J. Khanna). Therefore, it would be impossible to hack or tamper with the firmware of the EVM (¶42 J. Khanna).Return to ballot paper voting is not feasibleThe Supreme Court highlighted the well-documented weaknesses of the ballot paper system, emphasising the impracticality of using it in a country with nearly 97 crore voters, numerous candidates, and extensive polling booths (¶72 J. Khanna, ¶4 J.Datta). Justice Khanna noted that EVMs have significant advantages, including the prevention of booth capturing, elimination of invalid votes, reduced paper usage, and administrative efficiency (¶72 J. Khanna).Justice Datta concurred, stating that the suggestion to revert to the paper ballot system was an attempt to discredit the EVM system and create unnecessary doubts among the electorate. He affirmed that reverting to the old system was not feasible and emphasised the importance of improving the EVMs or developing better systems in the future (¶¶4-5 J.Datta).Physical access to VVPAT slips or need to increase the verification of VVPAT slipsJustice Khanna emphasised that while voters have a fundamental right to ensure their vote is accurately recorded and counted, this does not mean that the way to secure this right is to require 100% counting of VVPAT slips or allow voters to physically access the slips. (¶69 J. Khanna). It was further held that increasing the number of VVPAT slip counts would delay the results, require double the manpower, and introduce more human errors and increase the potential for manipulation. Justice Khanna noted that data does not support the need for such an increase in verification (¶70 J. Khanna).Justice Datta pointed out that existing measures, such as tallying VVPAT slips in five EVMs per assembly constituency, as established in N. Chandrababu Naidu v. Union of India (2024 INSC 341), has ensured transparency and reliability without any mismatches (¶¶10-11 J. Datta).Directions issued by the CourtFinally, Justice Khanna issued two directives to further bolster the credibility of the electoral process: Firstly, the symbol loading units of VVPATs must be securely sealed and stored with EVMs in strong rooms for 45 days after elections, with seals signed by candidates or their representatives. Secondly, candidates ranked second or third behind the highest polled candidate can request engineers to verify the burnt memory of EVMs within seven days of result declaration, covering five percent of EVMs per constituency. The costs for the same will be borne by candidates, and will be refunded if the EVM is found to be tampered (¶76 J. Khanna).Prepared by Sandhya (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

31,21-03-2024,M.K. RANJITSINH vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 838/2019,Steps needed to protect the Great Indian Bustard from potential extinction.,"M.K. RANJITSINH V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 280 (21 March 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  (i) What steps should be taken to protect the Great Indian Bustard?(ii) Whether the order of the Supreme Court restricting overhead transmission lines over 99,000 sq km needs reconsideration.(iii) Whether a committee of experts is required for monitoring and preparing data to ensure protection for the declining Great Indian Bustard population.Factual Background:  The Great Indian Bustard is typically found in arid or grassland regions in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Recent studies have indicated that the species is at risk of extinction, and the bird has been classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A significant factor contributing to the decline in the Great Indian Bustard population was collisions with overhead electricity transmission wires.A writ petition under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution was filed in the Supreme Court of India seeking guidelines for the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard. On 19 April 2021, the Court issued an interim order imposing restrictions on the installation of overhead transmission lines across an area covering approximately 99,000 square kilometers. It mandated that future power lines in Great Indian Bustard habitats be placed underground. Existing power lines in priority areas were also directed to transitioned to underground lines, with the immediate installation of bird diverters.Subsequently, the Ministries of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, Power, and New and Renewable Energy sought amendments to the Court’s directions, citing potential adverse impacts on solar power generation and India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to transition away from fossil fuels and reduce emissions.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court, while emphasizing the critical importance of proactively protecting Great Indian Bustards, overturned the earlier interim order dated 19 April 2021. The Court held that there are no valid grounds for a blanket prohibition on solar power transmission lines across a 99,000 square kilometer area, as converting all lines to underground poses technical challenges. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Recognising the complex interplay between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, the Supreme Court highlighted the need for a balanced approach.The Court constituted an expert committee, which was given a broad mandate, including assessing the feasibility of underground lines and effectiveness of bird diverters, and was directed to submit its report by July 31, 2024.Reasons for the Decision:  India’s commitment to international conventionsThe Supreme Court acknowledged that to combat climate change on a global scale, India had made international commitments through agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy (¶11). One of these commitments was to achieve approximately fifty percent of cumulative electric power from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 (¶15(a)). The promotion of renewable energy was also intended to play a crucial role in promoting social equity by providing access to clean and affordable energy.Not feasible to convert all transmission lines into underground power transmission linesThe Supreme Court underscored the importance of promoting solar energy as a pivotal measure in the global shift towards cleaner fuel alternatives. The Court noted that India had significant solar energy potential (¶37). Solar photovoltaic power could provide cooking, lighting, and other energy solutions for millions in Indian villages, resulting in social and economic benefits such as reducing indoor air pollution health risks, creating village-level jobs, and improving living standards (¶37).The Supreme Court highlighted the challenges in converting all transmission lines to underground power lines, emphasizing that a balanced approach is required which considers both the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard and broader environmental goals (¶60). It was noted that undergrounding power lines may protect the Great Indian Bustard but poses practical challenges such as safety risks, higher costs, and technical impracticality for lines above 60 kV (¶52). The Electricity Act does not facilitate land acquisition for underground cables, unlike overhead lines, which only require right of way (¶52(f)). Moreover, the conversion could hinder renewable energy development in Rajasthan and Gujarat, crucial for meeting growing power demands and international climate commitments (¶52(j)). Additionally, the Court acknowledged that the decision of whether to lay underground power lines is a matter of environmental policy, requiring input from domain experts. Therefore, the Court recommended appointing an expert committee to assess the situation comprehensively (¶61).The right to a healthy environment and the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate changeThe Supreme Court noted, in light of its various decisions in MC Mehta v. Kamal Nath (2000 INSC 329), Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board v. C Kenchappa (2006 INSC 323), and Bombay Dyeing & Co Ltd v. Bombay Environmental Action Group (2006 INSC 993), that the right to a clean environment, which falls under Article 21 (Right to Life) of the Constitution, was threatened by climate change (¶¶ 21, 23). Additionally, it was recognized that Article 14 (Right to Equality) would also be infringed as climate change would disproportionately affect some individuals over others. Consequently, the Supreme Court recognized the right to a healthy environment and the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a constitutional right (¶27).Duty of the Court to give effect to international agreements and treatiesThe Supreme Court held that despite India’s international obligations not being incorporated into domestic law in this case, the Court must consider these obligations seriously when adjudicating writ petitions (¶58). It also noted that it could not allow writ petitions to interfere with the fulfillment of India’s legal obligations (¶58).Prepared by Nishika (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

32,21-03-2024,NOBLE M PAIKADA vs UNION OF INDIAC.A. No. 1628-1629/2021,Challenge to exemptions from environmental clearances for roads and pipelines.,"NOBLE M PAIKADA V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 241 (21 March 2024)Justices:  Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Sanjay KarolQuestion(s):  Whether Item 6 in the notification dated 28 March 2020, which granted a complete exemption from needing prior Environmental Clearance to unearth soil for creating roads, pipelines etc., was arbitrary and unconstitutional?Factual Background:  On 14 September 2006, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (“MoEF”) issued a notification (“2006 Notification”) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (“EP Act”). The 2006 Notification included a schedule listing what constituted Category A and B construction projects. The 2006 Notification stated that all construction projects falling under Category A or B will require an Environmental Clearance (“EC”); permission was required from a regulatory authority before starting a new project or expanding an existing one.On 15 January 2016 the MoEF issued another notification (“2016 Notification”) (after inviting objections from the public) that added an exception for certain types of projects which no longer required an EC. Item 6 of the 2016 Notification exempted dredging and removal of silt from dams, reservoirs, rivers and canals for building or maintenance.On 28 March 2020, the MoEF, without public consultations, came out with a new notification (“2020 Notification”) that amended the 2016 Notification. Item 6 now allowed the extraction of ordinary soil for “linear projects” like roads, pipelines etc. without an EC.The 2020 Notification was challenged before the National Green Tribunal (“NGT”) which held that a complete exception for linear projects cannot be provided, rather appropriate safeguards that define the process of excavation and impose a limit on soil extraction must be added. An appeal against the NGT’s decision was filed before the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Division Bench (two judges) of the Supreme Court held that the decision to directly issue the 2020 Notification without holding public consultations rendered the new Item 6 unconstitutional and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to live in a pollution-free environment. Further, the Supreme Court held that Item 6 of the 2020 Notification, in the absence of any specific directions, definitions and safeguards, was vague and arbitrary. The Court accordingly struck down Item 6 of the 2020 Notification. The decision of the Court was authored by Justice Oka.Reasons for the Decision:  Failure to invite objections from the citizensThe Supreme Court noted that the 2016 Notification was published only after following the procedure for considering objections from the public, as provided under Rule 5(3) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 read with Section 3 of the EP Act (¶22). However, the 2020 Notification did not adhere to this requirement (¶22).The Supreme Court further reasoned that Article 21 of the Constitution had been read to guarantee a right to live in a pollution-free environment. Citizens had a corresponding fundamental duty to protect and improve the environment under Article 51A, hence, the Indian people formed a major stakeholder in environmental matters and their involvement cannot be bypassed without good reasons (¶22).Notification issued with improper hasteThe Supreme Court observed that the 2020 notification was issued a mere two days after the start of the pan-India lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic (¶24). The Court noted there had been no hurry to modify the 2016 Notification through the 2020 Notification, when all construction had come to a standstill because of the lockdown, and no need to forgo the aforementioned public consultations. Consequently, the Court held the addition of Item 6 through the 2020 Notification to be illegal and unconstitutional (¶24).Arbitrariness and lack of clarityThe Supreme Court observed that the purpose of the 2006 Notification was to introduce ECs to mitigate the environmental damage occurring as a result of industrialisation. Thus, any exception to the EC procedure must be specific and well-reasoned (¶25). The Court also found Item 6 to be uncertain and unclear, because it provided an exemption for digging ordinary soil for use in linear projects, without mentioning either the quantity, or the manner, or area in which soil could be dug (¶25).Moreover, the Supreme Court also noted that the term “linear projects” was undefined and could technically include anything under its ambit (¶25). The Court deemed that the lack of proper parameters and the absence of a regulatory body to categorise a project as linear or non-linear rendered the exemption vague and vulnerable to misuse (¶25).Prepared by Virendra Pratap Singh Rathod (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

33,18-03-2024,NAVAS @ MULANAVAS vs STATE OF KERALACrl.A. No. 1215/2011,Suitable term of imprisonment for murder.,"NAVAS @ MULANAVAS V. STATE OF KERALA2024 INSC 215 (18 March 2024)Justices:  Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Kalpathy V. Viswanathan, Justice Sandeep MehtaQuestion(s):  What is the suitable term of imprisonment that should be imposed for the offence of murder?Factual Background:  The Appellant was convicted by both the Trial Court and the Kerala High Court for offences under Sections 302 (murder), 449 (house-trespass), and 309 (attempt to commit suicide) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”). The case involved house trespass and the killing of four family members, including a child and an elderly woman, followed by an attempt to commit suicide by the Appellant.Initially, the Trial Court sentenced the Appellant to death. However, the Kerala High Court subsequently commuted this sentence to thirty years of imprisonment without any possibility of remission. The Appellant, thereafter, appealed to the Supreme Court against his conviction and sentence.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the Appellant’s conviction but reduced the sentence for the offence of murder from thirty years without remission, to twenty-five years without remission, including the period already served. The judgement of the Court was authored by Justice Viswanathan.The Supreme Court illustratively laid down the aggravating and mitigating circumstances for determining the minimum sentence (without remission) to be imposed while commuting a death sentence. In the present case, the Court held that the relatively young age of the Appellant when he committed the crime (twenty eight years), the absence of any financial motive, and no attempt to escape from the crime scene, were mitigating factors. The fact that the decision primarily relied on circumstantial evidence and the Appellant had already served more than eighteen years in jail while showcasing positive conduct throughout, further influenced the decision to reduce the sentence. Reasons for the Decision:  Balance between public safety and individual freedom to ensure proportionality in sentencingThe Supreme Court relied on the case of Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka (2007 INSC 653), where it had previously laid down that in cases of murder, the court can impose a graver form of imprisonment, beyond the standard fourteen years of life imprisonment without remission, without resorting to the death penalty, to ensure the punishment is appropriate for the crime committed. (¶24). This helps resolve situations where the case does not warrant the death penalty but a fourteen-year sentence is also inadequate (¶24). This principle was reaffirmed in Union of India v. V. Sriharan (2015 INSC 886), which clarified that life imprisonment means incarceration for the convict’s entire life, subject to possible remission, entrusting courts with the discretion to determine the appropriate length of life imprisonment (¶25).Therefore, the Supreme Court emphasised that determining the appropriate length of imprisonment requires careful consideration and discretion, as there is no strict formula. There is a need for a proportionate sentence that fits the crime and respects individual liberty. It was held that courts must adopt a balanced approach and avoid undue leniency, which can undermine public confidence, while ensuring that sentences are not excessively harsh (¶27).Weighing between aggravating and mitigating factorsThe Supreme Court pointed out certain relevant factors which can be taken into consideration while deciding on the sentencing of the convict before the powers of remission can be invoked. The list consisted of several factors including- the number of victims and their age and gender, the nature of injuries, the offender’s motive, criminal history of offender, premeditated nature of the offence, the possibility of committing the offence again in future, relationship between the offender and the victim, and breach of trust. The positive factors such as age of the accused, chance of rehabilitation, remorsefulness of accused, their family background, and their socio-economic condition , also plays an important role in weighing the factors (¶57).While weighing the actions of the Appellant on this scale, the Supreme Court observed that on the aggravating side, the act was planned and premeditated, the victims were unarmed, one of whom was a child and one was an old lady. Furthermore, the nature of injuries on the body of deceased persons showcases the brutality of the Appellant (¶58). On the mitigating side, the age of the Appellant, lack of financial gain from the offence, no attempt to escape and positive behaviour of the Appellant in jail were taken into consideration (¶59). As a result of this balance, the Court modified the sentence to twenty-five years without remission, including the period already undergone by the Appellant (¶60).Prepared by Meemansha Choudhary (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"
34,11-03-2024,DEVU G. NAIR vs THE STATE OF KERALACrl.A. No. 1730/2024,Habeas corpus petition to secure release of relationship-partner from parents.,"DEVU G. NAIR V. THE STATE OF KERALA2024 INSC 228 (11 March 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj Misra Question(s):  Whether the Appellant’s habeas corpus petition to secure the release of her relationship-partner should be allowed? Factual Background:  The Appellant, and ‘X’, the detainee, were women in a same-sex relationship. The Appellant alleged that ‘X’ was being unlawfully confined by her parents to keep ‘X’ apart from the Appellant. Thus the Appellant filed a habeas corpus plea in the Kerala High Court seeking the release of ‘X’.The High Court instructed the Secretary of the District Legal Services Authority (“DLSA”) to visit ’X’s residence and record her statements to determine if she is being held illegally. Subsequently, the High Court ordered ‘X’ to participate in counselling sessions at an authorised centre.The Appellant challenged this order before the Supreme Court and argued that having the Secretary of the DLSA record ‘X’s statements while she remained in her parents’ custody would be ineffective. Furthermore, the Appellant claimed that mandating counselling sessions for the detenu was fundamentally flawed and interfered with her autonomy.The Supreme Court directed ‘X’s’ parents to produce her before the Family Court in Kollam by 8 February 2023. An interview with Ms. Saleena V G Nair, a Member of the e-Committee of the Supreme Court, was arranged to ascertain 'X's' wishes.The Principal Judge of the Family Court and Ms. Nair submitted reports indicating that 'X' freely expressed her wish to focus on her career and voluntarily reside with her parents. ‘X’ described the Appellant as an ""intimate friend"" but stated she did not currently wish to marry or live with the Appellant.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court found no reason to doubt Ms. Nair’s report and decided not to interfere. However, the Court observed that High Courts should respect people's sexual orientation and identity without trying to undermine or alter them through therapy or other measures. The Constitution protects the rights and dignity of members of the LGBTQ+ community and courts must respect the autonomy of such individuals. The judgement of the Court was authored by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.The Supreme Court also established guidelines emphasising the importance of prioritising habeas corpus petitions, ensuring privacy, safety, and non-discrimination, promptly releasing detained individuals, and providing immediate police protection. These guidelines are for courts handling cases where the police or family members attempt to intervene with personal relationships that individuals have freely chosen.Reasons for the Decision:  Counselling should not be to overcome the will of the person (LGBTQ+)The Supreme Court was concerned that the counselling should not be used as a tool to subdue the person's will, especially about their sexual orientation (¶12). The Supreme Court stated that judges should not try to change a person's identity or sexual orientation through counselling, and it is improper for judges to replace the ideals guaranteed by the Constitution with their own subjective beliefs (¶13). The Supreme Court stated that ensuring the fundamental rights and dignity of intimate partners and LGBTQ+ community members in illegal detention is essential (¶17).The concept of ‘family’ is not limited to natal familyThe Supreme Court emphasised the importance of considering a person’s chosen family, beyond the traditional natal family in cases like habeas corpus petitions (¶14). It also stressed the need for precise guidelines to avoid misunderstandings and ensure fairness in such situations (¶15).The Supreme Court framed the guidelines related to the writ of habeas corpusThe Supreme Court issued comprehensive guidelines for courts handling requests from couples for police protection or writs of habeas corpus alleging interference from family members (¶16). These guidelines emphasise prioritising habeas corpus and protection petitions to avoid delays and not scrutinising the exact relationship between the appellant and the detained person (¶16). Some other key guidelines issued include:Courts must foster a free and open dialogue to determine the detained person's wishes, facilitate in-person interactions with judges, conduct in-camera proceedings, and ensure privacy and safety (¶16).They must avoid influencing the detained person's wishes, provide comfortable facilities and breaks, and maintain a friendly demeanour (¶16).Courts can determine age but should not dismiss petitions solely based on minority status and must show empathy and avoid homophobic or transphobic views (¶16).Detained individuals must be released immediately, with immediate police protection provided to those at risk, ensuring their privacy and dignity (¶16).The court's role is limited to determining the person's will without altering their sexual orientation or gender identity, and it must promptly address any derogatory conduct (¶16).Courts must exercise caution when passing judgments or comments on sexual orientation and gender identity, recognizing these as privacy-sensitive matters (¶16).Prepared by Sandhya (Intern)Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgement Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

35,07-03-2024,JAVED AHMAD HAJAM vs THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRACrl.A. No. 886/2024,Quashing of criminal proceedings against individual for WhatsApp status critical of government policy.,"JAVED AHMAD HAJAM V. THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA2024 INSC 187 (7 March 2024)Justices:  Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Ujjal BhuyanQuestion(s):  Whether the criminal proceedings initiated against the Appellant for his WhatsApp status criticising the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution and wishing Happy Independence Day to Pakistan should be extinguished.Factual Background:  The Appellant was a Professor at Sanjay Ghodawat College in District Kolhapur, Maharashtra. He used to live in District Baramulla, Kashmir. The appellant posted two WhatsApp statuses:(i) “August 5 – Black Day Jammu & Kashmir.” & “14th August – Happy Independence Day Pakistan.”(ii) “Article 370 was abrogated, we are not happy.”A First Information Report (“FIR”) was registered against the Appellant for posting these WhatsApp status under Section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”). Section 153-A of IPC provides for punishment for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds such as religion, race, place of birth, residence, language and doing acts prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony.The Appellant filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court to quash the FIR. The High Court refused to quash the FIR. The Appellant approached the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court quashed the FIR registered against the appellant under Section 153-A IPC. The Court held that the right to dissent against government decisions in a legitimate and lawful manner is an integral part of the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Oka.Reasons for the Decision:  Ingredients of Section 153-A IPC not fulfilledThe Supreme Court noted that the intention to cause disorder or provoke people to violence is a necessary ingredient to commit the offence under Section 153-A IPC (¶6). The Court found that the words used by the Appellant did not reflect any intention to cause disharmony between two groups (¶10). The Court further noted that the words used by the Appellant in his WhatsApp status did not refer to any religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community (¶9).Reasonable man standardThe Supreme Court noted that the effect of the words used by the Appellant on his WhatsApp status will have to be judged from the standards of reasonable women and men. The test to be applied is not the effect of the words on some individuals who see a danger in every hostile point of view (¶11). Merely because a few individuals may develop hatred or ill will is not sufficient to attract Section 153-A IPC (¶11).Right to DissentThe Supreme Court stated that the status of the Appellant was intended to criticise the action of the Union Government which abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution of India (¶9). The Court held that the Constitution of India, under Article 19(1)(a), guarantees freedom of speech and expression which includes the right to criticise the action of abrogation of Article 370 or, for that matter, any decision of the State (¶9). The Court noted that if every criticism or protest of the actions of the State is to be held as an offence under Section 153-A, democracy will not survive (¶10).Right to extend good wishes to the citizens of the other countriesWith respect to the WhatsApp status wishing Happy Independence Day to Pakistan, the Supreme Court held that every citizen has the right to extend good wishes to the citizens of the other countries on their respective independence days (¶12). The Court noted that it’s a gesture of goodwill and harmful motives cannot be attributed to the appellant only because he belongs to a particular religion (¶12).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

36,04-03-2024,SITA SOREN vs UNION OF INDIACrl.A. No. 451/2019,Whether a legislator enjoys constitutional immunity from accusations of accepting bribes in connection with their vote in Parliament or a state legislature.,"SITA SOREN V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 161 (4 March 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Ajjikuttira S. Bopanna, Justice M. M. Sundresh, Justice Pamidighantam S. Narasimha, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Sanjay Kumar, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Does a legislator enjoy immunity from prosecution under Article 105(2) or Article 194(2) of the Constitution of India for accepting bribes to vote in Parliament or a State Legislative Assembly?Factual Background:  In 2012, the Election Commission of India released a notification to fill up two vacant seats in the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand. The election was stopped as evidence emerged that the integrity of the election had been compromised. A CBI investigation found that the Petitioner, a member of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly, had demanded a payment of ?50 lakh from a Rajya Sabha candidate for proposing his nomination and an additional ?1 crore for voting in his favour, which was duly paid. The Petitioner was charged with bribery and criminal conspiracy under Sections 171E and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 respectively, and criminal misconduct under Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Crucially it emerged that while Petitioner was accused of receiving a bribe from one candidate for casting her vote in his favour, she had instead voted in favour of another candidate.In the Jharkhand High Court, the petitioner sought to quash proceedings against her by relying on the Constitution Bench (five judges) decision in P. V. Narasimha Rao v. State [1998 INSC 185] (“P.V. Narasimha Rao”). In P.V. Narasimha Rao, few Members of Parliament were accused of accepting bribes to vote against a no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha and the Supreme Court held that the immunity from criminal prosecution provided to parliamentarians (under Art. 105(2) of the Constitution of India) extended not only to anything said or any vote given but also to acts connected to a speech or vote in the Legislature. On 17 February 2014, the Jharkhand High Court rejected the plea to quash proceedings against the Petitioner. The Petitioner subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court, where the correctness of the judgment in P.V. Narasimha Rao was questioned. Therefore, the Petitioner’s case was referred to a Seven Judge Bench.The Petitioner contended that the P.V. Narasimha Rao judgment was correct, as it was crucial for safeguarding legislators from coercion. They highlighted the importance of providing absolute protection to legislators for actions done in the course of their legislative duties. The Respondents (Union of India) contended that this immunity shouldn't cover activities that disrupt the legislative process or involve bribery, as such behaviour has no room in a functioning democracy.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court unanimously held that legislators are not entitled to immunity under Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution of India for engaging in acts of bribery. This Seven Judge Bench overturned the judgment in P.V. Narasimha Rao.The Supreme Court established a dual criterion for determining when lawmakers could be granted immunity under Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of Constitution: first, immunity applied when the activity pertained to a collective function of the legislature, and secondly, the action in question must be inherently linked to the fulfilment of the duty of a legislator. The judgment was authored by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Parliamentary Privileges in IndiaThe Supreme Court held that Article 105(1) and (2) of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech in Parliament, which is essential for the functioning of Parliament (¶65). The Court observed that Article 105(3) allows Parliament to legislate on immunities within constitutional limits (¶68). Without legislation, Parliament can claim only those immunities that the House of Commons (of the United Kingdom) possessed at the time of commencement of the Constitution of India, and the Parliament is not the sole judge to decide on its privileges (¶69). The Court held that Members of the House of Parliament or Legislature cannot claim any privilege or immunity unconnected with the functioning of the House (¶75).Bribery is not protected by Parliamentary PrivilegeThe Supreme Court held that privileges of the House, its members, and Committees extend beyond specific locations or acts (¶99). Speeches made in Parliament or Legislature are immune from court proceedings (¶99). Articles 105 and 194 aim to foster fearless debate, free from third-party influence (¶104). While the majority in P.V. Narasimha Rao interpreted the phrase ""in respect of"" in Section 105 of Constitution broadly, linking it to anything related to votes or speeches by legislators, the Supreme Court in the present case disagreed, and restricted the scope of privileges to matters directly connected to votes or speeches (¶100).The Supreme Court found that bribery undermines the core principles of democracy and is not immune under Article 105(2); members involved can face prosecution for bribery (¶¶104, 188.7). The Supreme Court clarified that bribery is not within the scope of parliamentary immunity (¶¶112-113). Such crimes don't relate to the essential functions of a legislator and can be prosecuted by a criminal court despite possible contempt proceedings by the House (¶113).Stage at which offence of bribery crystallisesThe Supreme Court held that the offence of bribery is committed upon the acceptance or agreement to accept money, regardless of whether the promised action is carried out (¶107). Bribery is deemed complete upon the exchange of illegal gratification, irrespective of how the legislator ultimately votes (¶188.11).Prepared by Shambhavi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

37,29-02-2024,HIGH COURT BAR ASSOCIATION ALLAHABAD vs THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESHCrl.A. No. 3589/2023,Whether interim orders passed by High Courts automatically expire after six months.,"HIGH COURT BAR ASSOCIATION ALLAHABAD V. THE STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH2024 INSC 150 (29 February 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Abhay S. Oka, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Pankaj Mithal, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  (i) Can the Supreme Court of India order that all interim orders of the High Courts staying proceedings will automatically expire after a certain period? (ii) Can the Supreme Court of India direct High Courts to decide pending cases within a fixed timeframe? Factual Background:  In the case of Asian Resurfacing of Road Agency v. Central Bureau of Investigation (2018 INSC 282) (“Asian Resurfacing”) a Three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India was deciding whether an order of framing charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is interlocutory in nature and can be challenged before the High Court. In deciding this issue, the Court in Asian Resurfacing directed that when a High Court stays proceedings after deciding to hear a challenge to an order framing charges, the challenge must be decided on a day-to-today basis to avoid undue delay.Further, the Court in Asian Resurfacing directed that in all pending cases before the High Courts, where a stay in a civil or criminal trial is operating, the case must be decided within a maximum period of six months. Failure to adhere to this timeframe would result in the automatic expiration of the stay, unless a reasoned order for extending the stay is passed. Absent such an order extending the stay, the Trial Court may resume proceedings without further notice.On 1 December 2023, another three judge bench comprising Chief Justice Chandrachud, Justice Pardiwala and Justice Misra expressed doubts regarding the correctness of the broad formulations in Asian Resurfacing and referred the matter to a Constitution Bench (five judges) for reconsideration.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Constitution Bench unanimously held that an automatic expiration of interim orders after a period of six months is impermissible. Further, the Court held that issuing blanket directions that the High Courts should hear all cases where interim stays are operating on a daily basis and decide them within a stipulated time frame was beyond the powers of the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Oka, while Justice Mithal wrote a separate concurring opinion.Reasons for the Decision:  An interim order cannot come to an end automaticallyThe Supreme Court held that the principles of natural justice require that an order rescinding or modifying interim relief should only be passed after hearing the affected parties. The directions issued in Asian Resurfacing regarding the automatic expiration of interim stay orders passed by all High Courts does not take into account the merits of individual cases. There are many reasons why a High Court may be unable to hear a case at a particular time. If, without any application of mind, an interim order automatically expires and the litigant is not responsible for the delay, the litigant would suffer for no fault of their own and this would violate the basic tenets of justice (¶16, ¶4 J. Mithal).Justice Mithal in his separate concurring opinion found that the stay order granted in any proceeding would not automatically expire after a certain period, unless the opposite side files an application for setting it aside. Further, a stay order once passed cannot be rescinded or varied unless a reasoned order is passed by the Court following the principles of natural justice (¶¶5,7 J. Mithal).Scope of exercise of powers under Article 142 of the ConstitutionThe Supreme Court clarified that the directions issued in Asian Resurfacing were issued under Article 142 of the Constitution, a power which can be exercised only in extraordinary situations for doing complete justice between the parties before the Court. However, the question regarding the duration of the interim orders in various other proceedings apart from proceedings under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 did not specifically arise for consideration before the Court in Asian Resurfacing (¶19).Furthermore, the Supreme Court laid down the following guidelines for the exercise of its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution: (i) It cannot be exercised to nullify the benefits derived by a large number of litigants based on judicial orders validly passed in their favour; (ii) The Court cannot ignore the substantive rights of the litigants; (iii) The Court can issue directions to the Courts for streamlining procedural issues, however, the Court cannot affect the substantive rights of those litigants who are not parties to the case before it. The right to be heard before an adverse order is passed is a substantive right; and (iv) It must not defeat the principles of natural justice (¶22).Blanket directions cannot be issued to limit the jurisdiction of High CourtThe Supreme Court held that a High Court, being a constitutional court, is not judicially subordinate to the Supreme Court (¶23). It emphasized that the High Court's authority under Article 227 of the Constitution to have judicial superintendence over all the courts within its jurisdiction includes the power to stay proceedings in such courts (¶24). The Supreme Court further stated that imposing restrictions on the High Court's power to grant interim relief, such as limiting interim stay orders to six months, would impermissibly encroach on the High Court's powers under Article 226 (¶24).Directions to decide pending cases in a time-bound manner should be issued only in exceptional circumstancesThe Supreme Court emphasized that directions leading to the automatic expiration of stay orders and the day-to-day hearing of cases amounted to judicial legislation, which is impermissible. Only the legislature can provide that cases of a particular category should be decided within a specific time (¶28). The High Courts cannot be directed only to prioritize cases where stay orders are operating on a day-to-day basis. There may be other cases like criminal appeals or bail applications, which may require more attention (¶30). Each court has its own pattern of pendency and disposal and therefore, the concerned courts are best placed to decide the issue of what cases to prioritise. Thus, orders which set strict deadlines for disposing of a case should only be passed in exceptional circumstances (¶32).Prepared by Vidhi GuptaCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

Pardiwala and Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  Whether there was electoral malpractice in the conduct of elections for the post of Mayor to the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation on 30 January 2024?Factual Background:  According to Section 38 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 (“Punjab Act”), the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation was required to elect one of its elected members as Mayor of the Corporation in its first meeting of the year. Section 60 of the Punjab Act provided that the Deputy Commissioner of the Union Territory of Chandigarh had to nominate a councillor, who was not a candidate to the election, to preside over the meeting. One of the Respondents, Mr. Anil Masih, a councillor who was not a candidate, was nominated as the Presiding Officer for the election meeting. It had been agreed between the Appellant and Respondents that the entire voting and election process would be video-recorded to ensure free and fair elections.There were two candidates for the post of the Mayor. The first candidate was the Appellant, Kuldeep Kumar, who was jointly fielded by the Aam Aadmi Party (“AAP”) and the Indian National Congress (“INC”). The second candidate was Manoj Sonkar, who was set up by the Bharatiya Janata Party (“BJP”). There were a total of thirty-six voters eligible to vote in the election. The result sheet, signed by Anil Masih as the Presiding Officer of the election, indicated that of the thirty-six votes polled, eight votes were declared invalid, Kuldeep Kumar received twelve votes, and Manoj Sonkar received sixteen votes. On this basis, the Presiding Officer Anil Masih declared Manoj Sonkar elected as Mayor.The Appellant Kuldeep Kumar immediately filed a writ petition before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, challenging the election result and alleging electoral malpractices by the Presiding Officer Anil Masih during the counting of the votes. A Division Bench (two judges) of the High Court, in its interim order dated 31 January 2024, declined to stay the result of the election. The interim order of the High Court was challenged before the Supreme Court. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court set aside the result of the election as declared by the Presiding Officer, as it found that the eight invalid votes were, in truth, valid. Invoking its extraordinary power to do justice under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Court declared the Appellant, Kuldeep Kumar, as the validly elected Mayor of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation.Furthermore, the Court directed that a show cause notice be issued to the Presiding Officer as to why proceedings under Section 340 of the Criminal Code of Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”) should not be instituted against him for making a false statement before the Court. Section 340 of the CrPC allows for a preliminary enquiry to ascertain whether any offence affecting administration of justice has been committed in respect of a document produced in court or given in evidence in a proceeding in that Court. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  Invalidity and Defacement of Ballot PapersThe Supreme Court examined the video recording of the voting and the eight ballot papers that were declared invalid, and found that all those purportedly invalid ballot papers had been cast in favour of the Appellant (¶26). In all those ballot papers, the Presiding Officer had himself drawn a line as a mark and claimed that mark as a ground to declare the ballots invalid (¶27).The Supreme Court found that this was in violation of the Election Regulations framed by the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, which provided only three cases in which a ballot could be declared invalid: (i) if a member voted for more than one candidate; or (ii) if a member placed any mark on the paper through which they could be identified; or (iii) if a mark indicating the vote is placed in such a manner that it creates doubt regarding the candidate for whom the vote was cast (¶28). The Court held that none of these circumstances were present in the case at hand (¶29). The Court concluded that none of the eight purportedly invalid ballots were, in fact, invalid and that the Presiding Officer had deliberately attempted to deface the ballots by placing his own mark on them (¶31). Accordingly, the Court found that the Presiding Officer had unlawfully altered the result of the Mayoral election and set aside the outcome of the election (¶¶32, 33).Invocation of Article 142During the course of the proceedings before the Supreme Court, Manoj Sonkar, who had been declared the Mayor on the basis of the election, resigned (¶34). The Respondents submitted that Section 38 of the Punjab Act required that in case of any vacancy in the Mayor’s office, the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation should elect one of its members as Mayor within one month (¶34). However, the Court found that it was inappropriate to set aside the entire election process when the only infirmity was at the stage of counting of the votes by the Presiding Officer (¶35). Recognizing its role in ensuring fair and free elections to maintain trust in democracy (¶36), the Court invoked its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to hold that the Appellant, Kuldeep Kumar, had twenty votes once the ballots that had wrongly been invalidated were counted. It therefore declared the Appellant as the elected Mayor of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (¶¶38, 39).False Statement of Presiding OfficerThe Supreme Court saw the video recording of the counting process which showed the Presiding Officer signing all the ballot papers and also placing certain marks on some of the ballot papers (¶20). The Court ordered that the Presiding Officer present himself appear before the Court to explain his conduct (¶14). The Presiding Officer claimed before the Court that he had signed and put an ink mark declaring eight of the ballots to be invalid, as he found that those ballots had been defaced (¶15).The Supreme Court found that the Presiding Officer had knowingly made a false statement before the Court regarding his actions in defacing the ballot papers in order to declare them invalid (¶40). This statement was proven to be false in light of the video recordings showing the acts of the Presiding Officer during the counting of votes. Thus, the Court directed the Supreme Court Registry to issue notice to the Presiding Officer, Anil Masih, as to why Section 340 of the CrPC should not be invoked against him (¶41).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

39,15-02-2024,ASSOCIATION FOR DEMOCRATICS REFORMS vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 880/2017,Challenge to Electoral Bonds scheme.,"ASSOCIATION FOR DEMOCRATICS REFORMS V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 113 (15 February 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice Bhushan R. Gavai, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  (i) Whether the non-disclosure of funding to political parties under the Electoral Bond Scheme violates voters’ right to information? (ii) Whether unlimited corporate funding to political parties interferes with free and fair elections and equality?Factual Background:  The Finance Act, 2017 (“Finance Act”) amended the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (“RP Act”), the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”), and the Companies Act, 2013 (“Companies Act”).Section 29C of RP Act was amended to allow political parties to not disclose campaign contributions received through electoral bonds. Section 182(3) of Companies Act was amended to allow companies to not disclose details of political contributions made by them. Section 182(1) of Companies Act, which provided a cap on political funding by companies, was removed to allow unlimited corporate funding. The provision also previously restricted the companies’ contributions to their profits, but the amendment allowed even loss making companies to donate. Section 13A of IT Act was amended to allow political parties to not maintain a record of contributions received by electoral bonds.In January 2018, the government introduced the Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018. Under this Scheme, the State Bank of India (“SBI”) was authorised to sell Electoral Bonds in denominations of ?1,000, ?10,000, ?1,00,000, ?10,00,000, and ? 1,00,00,000. The Bonds allowed the identity of the purchaser to remain anonymous to everyone, except the SBI, who recorded the buyer’s Know Your Customer (“KYC”) details. The buyer of the Bond would then give the bond to a political party they wished to donate to. The Bonds would then be encashed by the political party.The Petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Electoral Bond Scheme and the amendments made by the Finance Act arguing that they prevented voters from knowing who was donating to political parties and legitimised electoral corruption between donors and parties. The Union of India argued that Electoral Bonds were introduced for the purpose of curbing black money in electoral financing. The donors to a political party often apprehended retribution from other political parties (that they did not donate to). Such apprehension incentivized donors to contribute unaccounted money to political parties outside of formal banking channels. The Union argued that the Electoral Bond Scheme maintains the confidentiality of donors and thereby incentivizes them to contribute clean money to political parties through recognised banking channels. Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018 and the amendments made by the Finance Act to Section 29C of the RP Act, Section 182(3) of the Companies Act and Section 13A(b) of IT Act are unconstitutional. The Court also held the deletion of the proviso to Section 182(1) of the Companies Act permitting unlimited corporate contributions to political parties even for loss making companies is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. The judgment of the Court was authored by Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud. Justice Sanjiv Khanna wrote a concurring but separate opinion.The Supreme Court also directed that SBI shall submit to the ECI by 6 March 2024: (i) details of the Electoral Bonds purchased from 12 April 2019 till date, to the Election Commission of India (“ECI”). The details shall include the date of purchase of each Bond, the name of the purchaser and the denomination of the Bond purchased; and (ii) details of political parties which have encashed Electoral Bonds since 12 April 2019 to date to the ECI including details of each Electoral Bond encashed by political parties, the date of encashment and the denomination of the Electoral Bond.The Court directed the ECI to publish the information shared by SBI on its official website within one week from the receipt of the information (by 13 March 2024).Reasons for the Decision:  Close association of politics & moneyThe Supreme Court noted that finance is crucial for electoral politics (¶46). Expenditure on political campaigns affects voting behaviour because of the impact of television advertisements, campaign events, and personal canvassing (¶48). The Court noted money also creates an entry barrier to politics by limiting the nature of candidates who can contest elections (¶50).Voter’s right to informationThe Supreme Court held that the action of voting is a form of expression protected by Article 19(1)(a)(Freedom of Speech and Expression) (¶71). The Court noted that the voters have a right to information that would allow them to cast their votes rationally and intelligently (¶77), and this includes the right to information about candidates (¶79). The Court held that this right to information extends to political parties as well, as they are a relevant political unit in the democratic electoral process (¶94) and voters associate candidates with the ideologies of their respective parties (¶89).The Supreme Court observed that an economically affluent person has a higher ability to make financial contributions to political parties, and there is a legitimate possibility that financial contributions to a political party could be exchanged for political favours such as introducing a policy change (¶100). The information about political funding would enable a voter to assess if there is a correlation between policy making and financial contributions (¶100).Test of proportionalityThe Supreme Court relied on the proportionality test to determine if the restriction on the fundamental right of right to information of voters is justified. The Court held that a measure restricting a fundamental right must have a “legitimate goal”, it must be a “suitable means” of reaching that goal, it must be the least restrictive measure, and must not have “a disproportionate impact” on the rights holder (¶105).Privacy of DonorsThe Supreme Court noted that a stated goal of the Electoral Bonds Scheme was to protect the donor’s privacy (¶131). The Court held that the citizens have informational privacy over their political beliefs. Information about a person’s political beliefs deduced through their political donations, can be used by both public and private actors to suppress dissent, discriminate, or harass individuals based on their political views (¶131).The Supreme Court observed that Section 29C of the RP Act mandates disclosure of information of contributions beyond ?20,000 in one financial year (¶165). The rationale of Section 29C(1) is that smaller donations (upto ?20,000) made by individuals do not have the ability to influence policy decisions and thus, the right to privacy of donors outweighs the public's right to information. But in the case of larger donations that may influence policy, the right to information of the public outweighs the right to privacy of the donor (¶167).Applying the proportionality test, the Supreme Court found that the Electoral Bonds Scheme did not balance fundamental right to information of voters with informational privacy of donors. The Scheme completely tilted the balance in favour of the purpose of informational privacy and underserved the informational interests of voters (¶168).The Supreme Court also held that political parties in power may have additional access to information regarding donations, and thus the privacy of donors can be breached. Thus, the entire objective of the Scheme is contradictory and inconsistent (¶128, ¶73 J. Khanna).Justice Khanna in his separate opinion held that the claim of privacy by a company would be restricted to the extent of protecting the privacy of individuals responsible for conducting the business of the company (¶73 J. Khanna). Since the affairs of a company have to be open to the shareholders and the public who interact with the body corporate, it is very difficult to claim a violation of privacy by such a body corporate (¶73 J. Khanna).Curbing Black MoneyThe Supreme Court applied the proportionality test and noted that there are other alternatives to curb black money which are less restrictive to the voter’s right to information such as the Electoral Trusts provided under Section 2(22AA) of the IT Act (¶121). In an Electoral Trust details of both the political parties and the contributor are maintained and provided to the income tax authorities, but which contributor has donated what and how much amount to which political party is not disclosed, thus balancing the privacy of donors and right to information of voters (¶¶121-122). Further, the RP Act mandates disclosure by Political Parties only of contributions of more than ?20,000 in a financial year. So, for contributions less than ?20,000 thousand, there is already anonymity under the law (¶124).The Supreme Court concluded that on an overall assessment, for contributions below ?20,000, contributions through other means of electronic transfer is a less restrictive means. For contributions above ?20,000, contributions through Electoral Trust is a less restrictive means. Hence, the Electoral Bonds Scheme is not the least restrictive means to achieve the purpose of curbing black money in the electoral process (¶129).Constitutionality of unlimited corporate fundingThe Supreme Court noted that Proviso of Section 182(1) of the Companies Act (before it was amended by the Finance Act, 2017) limited the contributions by companies for political purposes to seven and a half percent of its average net profits in the preceding three years (¶178). The Finance Act, 2017 removed the proviso and allowed unlimited contributions by companies to political parties and also, by removing the net-profit requirement, allowed even loss making shell companies to donate to political parties(¶178).The Supreme Court noted that the main reason for corporate funding of political parties is to influence the political process which may in turn improve the company’s business performance (¶210). Unlimited contribution by companies to political parties is against free and fair elections because it allows companies to use their resources to influence policy making (¶210). The Supreme Court held that the amendment to Section 182 is manifestly arbitrary as it places a profit-making company and a loss-making company at an equal footing and also a corporate and an individual on an equal footing without realising that the degree of harm arising from donations is higher in case of companies and specially loss-making companies (¶214).Justice Sanjiv Khanna in his separate opinion held that the invalidity of amendments to Section 182 of the Companies Act, which allowed unlimited donations, was more properly analysed using the proportionality standard than the manifest arbitrariness standard as the proportionality test ensures reasonableness (¶73 J. Khanna).Prepared by Priyanka SinghCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaJudgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

40,08-01-2024,BILKIS YAKUB RASOOL vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(Crl.) No. 491/2022,Challenge to the remission orders passed by the State of Gujarat releasing individuals convicted of gang rape during communal rights.,"BILKIS YAKUB RASOOL V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 24 (8 January 2024)Justices:  Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice Ujjal BhuyanQuestion(s):  (i) Whether a Writ Petition filed by the victim against the remission of convicts is maintainable under Article 32 of the Constitution? (ii) Whether public interest litigation (“PIL”) petitions can be filed against orders of remission of prisoners by the government? (iii) Whether the State of Gujarat was competent to pass the disputed orders of remission? and (iv) Whether the disputed orders of remission passed by the State of Gujarat releasing the convicted-accused (“convicted-Respondents”) were in accordance with the law?Factual Background:  The Petitioner was gang-raped by the convicted-Respondents during communal riots in Gujarat. The initial police complaint was filed in Gujarat. But the Gujarat police investigation concluded that the perpetrators of the crimes could not be traced and closed the case. The Petitioner challenged the closure of the case before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reopened the case and transferred the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (“CBI”). The CBI investigated the case and charged twenty persons with the crime of committing rape, murder and rioting with deadly weapons.The Supreme Court transferred the case for trial from Gujarat to a court in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Eleven of the accused persons were eventually convicted in 2008 by the Mumbai Trial Court for various offences including murder and gang-rape under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Bombay High Court and then the Supreme Court of India upheld their convictions.After serving fourteen years of their sentence of life imprisonment, the convicted-Respondents filed applications before the Gujarat High Court for remission (premature release) under Sections 432 and 433A of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (“CrPC”). The High Court found that the appropriate government to exercise the power of remission would be the State of Maharashtra, not Gujarat, since the convicts were convicted and sentenced in Maharashtra.While his remission application was pending before the authorities in the State of Maharashtra, one of the convicts filed a Writ Petition before the Supreme Court seeking the Court to direct the State of Gujarat to consider his remission application under its 1992 remission policy which was applicable when the crime was committed. The Supreme Court, in this case of Radheshyam Bhagwandas Shah vs. State of Gujarat (“Radheshyam Shah case”) passed an order on 13 May 2022 directing that under Section 432 of the CrPC, the appropriate government to consider the remission application would be the State in which the offence was committed and not the one where the trial was conducted. It ordered the State of Gujarat to consider the application for remission.The State of Gujarat accepted the remission application of all eleven convicted-Respondents. Following the approval of the Home Ministry of the Government of India, the Government of Gujarat passed the orders for remission of all eleven convicts on 10 August 2022. These remission orders were challenged by multiple petitions before the Supreme Court of India, including by the Petitioner-victim.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the Writ Petition filed by the Petitioner before the Supreme Court under Article 32 was maintainable. Because the Petitioner-victim’s Writ Petition was held to be maintainable, the Court did not answer the question on whether PIL petitions can be filed by other citizens to challenge remission orders. The Court found that the Government of Gujarat was not competent to pass the remission applications in favour of the convicted-Respondents. Therefore, the Supreme Court quashed the orders granting remission to the eleven convicts as illegal. The Supreme Court observed that the order in the Radheshyam Shah case directing the Government of Gujarat to consider the remission application was legally invalid because it was obtained by fraud. The judgment of the Court was unanimous and was authored by Justice Nagarathna.The eleven released convicts were directed to report back to concerned jail authorities within two weeks.Reasons for the Decision:  Maintainability of the Writ Petition filed in the Supreme CourtThe Respondents contended that the Petitioner ought to have initially approached the High Court of Gujarat instead of approaching the Supreme Court (¶22.1). The Supreme Court dismissed this contention and upheld the maintainability of the Writ Petition on the ground that the Petitioner was free to approach the Supreme Court directly since she was enforcing her fundamental rights under Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution (¶22.2). Article 32 of the Constitution allows citizens to approach the Supreme Court directly for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. Another reason was that the Supreme Court’s order in the Radheshyam Shah case could not be overruled by the High Court of Gujarat since a High Court cannot overrule an order of the Supreme Court (¶22.3). This necessitated that the Petitioner approach the Supreme Court.Jurisdiction of the State of GujaratRemission is the reduction in the period of sentence for an offence without changing its character. Here, the guilt of the offender and the sentence imposed by the court are not disputed, the only question is whether the convict should remain in prison for the entirety of their sentence (¶30.1). Section 432(1) of the CrPC says that if a person is sentenced to punishment for an offence, then the ‘appropriate government’ may remit the whole (or part) of the person’s sentence.Section 432(7) of the CrPC defines ‘appropriate government’ i.e., which State government had jurisdiction to pass the remission orders (¶33). The Supreme Court observed that Section 432(7) says that the ‘appropriate government’ will be the Government of the State in which the offender is sentenced (¶33.4). The State in whose territory or jurisdiction the offence took place or where the convict is imprisoned is not relevant (¶33.6). Since the convicts were sentenced by the Trial Court in Mumbai, it was the Government of Maharashtra which had the jurisdiction to consider the remission applications (¶33.8). Thus, the Court held that the Government of Gujarat had no authority to pass the remission orders under Section 432 and the orders were illegal (¶33.9).The Supreme Court found that the previous order of the Supreme Court in the Radheshyam Shah case, which directed the State of Gujarat to decide the remission applications of the convicts, was not the correct law and was contrary to previous judgments of the Supreme Court (¶36.4). Moreover, the Court found that the convict who approached the Supreme Court in this case committed fraud on the Court by suppressing material information including the fact that the State of Gujarat’s 1992 remission policy had been cancelled and that his remission application was already being processed by the State of Maharashtra following the order of the Gujarat High Court (¶¶36.1, 41). On this basis, the Court held that the previous order of the Supreme Court in the Radheshyam Shah case was not legally valid (¶46).Legality of remission ordersThe Supreme Court also found that the Government of Gujarat abused its discretion by usurping the remission powers vested in the Government of Maharashtra under Section 432(7) of the CrPC (¶50). The Court criticised the Government of Gujarat for its failure to file a review petition seeking correction of the previous order of the Supreme Court in the Radheshyam Shah case which had wrongly interpreted the law on remission (¶50.2). On this ground, the remission orders were also declared illegal and struck down (¶50.5).Conditions for Remission ApplicationsThe Supreme Court listed certain non-exhaustive conditions for entertaining remission applications under the CrPC (¶55):The application for remission under Section 432 of the CrPC could only be filed before the Government of the State within whose territorial jurisdiction the applicant was convicted and not before any other Government within whose territorial jurisdiction the applicant was transferred after conviction or where the offence had occurred.Compliance of Section 433A of the CrPC is mandatory whereby a person serving life imprisonment cannot seek remission unless at least fourteen years of imprisonment have been completed.The opinion of the Presiding Judge of the Court which had convicted the applicant must be mandatorily complied with as stated under Section 432(2) of the CrPC.The policy of remission applicable to a case will be the policy of the State which has the jurisdiction to consider that application. Ordinarily, the policy of remission applicable at the time of the conviction should apply.Final orders and observations on the rule of lawThe Supreme Court recognised that the convicted-Respondents had been granted freedom by illegal remission orders that violated the law (¶59). However, the convicts had prayed that the Court exercise its inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to ‘protect their liberty’ (¶59). The Court observed that a person is only entitled to freedom and liberty in accordance with the law (¶60). The rule of law could not be violated to protect the liberty of convicts who had abused the process of law in obtaining remission (¶69). The Court, thus, ordered the eleven convicts to report back to jail within two weeks (¶70).Prepared by Thejaswi MelarkodeCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaCase Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

41,03-01-2024,VISHAL TIWARI vs UNION OF INDIAW.P.(C) No. 162/2023,Plea challenging SEBI's investigation into the Adani Group and seeking constitution of Special Investigation Team (SIT).,"VISHAL TIWARI V. UNION OF INDIA2024 INSC 3 (3 January 2024)Justices:  Chief Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud, Justice Jamshed B. Pardiwala, Justice Manoj MisraQuestion(s):  (i) What is the scope of judicial review over the regulatory functions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”)? (ii) Whether the Supreme Court should transfer the investigation into the Adani Group from SEBI to a Special Investigation Team (“SIT”).Factual Background:  On 24 January 2023, the American investment research firm Hindenburg Research published a report accusing the Adani Group of companies of violating SEBI regulations, manipulating stock prices, and failing to disclose critical financial information. This report led to a significant decline in the share price of Adani Group of companies and consequently an erosion of investor wealth.Several petitions were filed before the Supreme Court concerning the need to protect investors from market shocks and investigate the Adani Group. The Court in its order dated 2 March 2023, directed SEBI to investigate the allegations of potential regulatory violations by the Adani Group. An expert committee was also established to assess the situation and recommend measures to enhance investor protection.The Petitioners sought to cancel certain amendments made to SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investments) Regulations, 2014 and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Regulations”) and requested the formation of a SIT to oversee the investigation. On 6 May 2023 the expert committee submitted its report and SEBI filed a status report on 25 August 2023. As on date of the judgment, SEBI had completed twenty two out of the twenty four investigations.Decision of the Supreme Court:  The Supreme Court held that the power of courts to interfere with the regulatory functions of SEBI is limited. The Court did not find any valid grounds to cancel the amendments made to SEBI Regulations. The Court held that there was no apparent failure in regulation by SEBI and hence there was no need to transfer the investigation to an SIT. The Court directed the Union Government and SEBI to consider the suggestions made by the expert committee to strengthen the regulatory framework. The judgment of the court was authored by Chief Justice Chandrachud.Reasons for the Decision:  The Supreme Court observed that the Court cannot act as an appellate authority to assess the correctness of policies formulated by statutory regulators like SEBI (¶¶15, 17). Judicial review is limited to assessing whether a policy violates fundamental rights, constitutional provisions, statutory laws, or is manifestly arbitrary. The Court further held that in technical areas, particularly economic and financial matters, courts should defer to the expertise of regulators who have considered expert opinions in formulating their policies (¶17).The Supreme Court upheld SEBI’s regulations, stating that the agency had properly explained the evolution and rationale behind its regulatory framework and that the procedures followed were not illegal or arbitrary (¶28).The Supreme Court found no evidence of regulatory failure by SEBI in its investigation into the Adani Group (¶36). The Court observed that its authority under Article 32 and Article 142 of the Constitution to transfer investigations should be used sparingly and only in extraordinary circumstances. The Court cannot intervene unless the investigating authority shows clear, willful, and deliberate inaction in conducting the investigation (¶32).Prepared by Benila B MCentre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of IndiaLink to Judgment (PDF)Judgment Summaries are prepared to help promote a better understanding of the decisions of the Supreme Court of India.

1,02-01-2025,URMILA DIXIT vs SUNIL SHARAN DIXITC.A. No. 10927/2024,"Right of a senior citizen to claim back their transferred property under the Section 23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007","URMILA DIXIT V. SUNIL SHARAN DIXIT2025 INSC 20 (2 January 2025)Justices:   Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Chudalayil T. RavikumarQuestion(s):    (i) Whether a property transferred by senior citizens by gift or any other medium  can be claimed back under the Section  23 of the Maintenance and Welfare of the Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 (“the Act”). (ii) Whether the authorities under the Section 23 of the Act can order eviction from the property and grant the possession to the concerned senior citizens.Factual Background:   Section 23 of the Act states that if the person who received property fails to take care of the giver, the transfer can be canceled, as if it were obtained by fraud or force. A Gift Deed was executed by the mother in favour of her son on 7 September 2019 of  the  property which she had  purchased on 23 January 1968. The Deed stated that the son would maintain the mother  and the same was registered on 9 September 2019. Allegedly, the same day a vachan patra/promissory note was executed by the son stating  that he will take care of the mother and father till the end of their life and if he does not do so, the mother will be at liberty to take back the Gift Deed. On 24 December 2020 the mother filed an application under the Section 23 of the Act before the Sub Divisional Magistrate alleging attacks by the son regarding  the further transfer of property, and sought cancellation of the Deed as there was no love and affection left between the parties. This application was allowed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate  and the deed was declared null and void (not valid in law). However, the son preferred an appeal which was dismissed on 25 April 2022 by the Collector. Subsequently, the son  filed a writ petition before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. A Single-Judge Bench upheld the order of the Collector and dismissed the writ petition. The son then filed a writ appeal, and a Division-Bench of the High Court reversed the order of the Single-Judge  and found  the deed valid. Consequently, the mother filed an appeal in the Supreme Court.Decision of the Supreme Court:   A Two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Single-Judge Bench of the High Court and the authorities  below and cancelled the Gift Deed because the conditions in the gift were not complied with. The Court also ruled  that the authorities while exercising jurisdiction under the Section 23 of the Act can order possession to be transferred. The judgment of the Court was authored by Justice Karol. Reasons for the Decision:   Liberal interpretation of the ActThe Supreme Court held that the objective of the Act is to  empower senior citizens to secure their rights promptly when they transfer a property subject to the condition of being maintained by the transferee (¶25). The Court referred to K. H. Nazar v. Mathew K. Jacob, (2019 INSC 1100), in which it was held  that the provisions of a beneficial legislation have to be interpreted with a purpose-oriented approach and the problem that a statute was designed to remedy should first be identified and then a meaning  that resolves the problem should be adopted (¶9). The Supreme Court ruled that the Statement of Object and Reasons and Preamble of the Act embodies  the intent of the Act which is to ensure effective maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens, guaranteed and recognised under the Constitution (¶12). Therefore, the Act is a beneficial legislation  aimed at securing the rights of senior citizens in view of the challenges faced by them and must be given a liberal meaning to it (¶14).  The Court observed  that it is the social obligation of the children to maintain their parents when they need them and it is bound by the Constitution to advance the cause of social justice pertaining to maintenance of parents or wife (¶¶15-16).Application of Section 23 of the ActThe Supreme Court, after scrutinizing the Gift Deed and Promissory Note, held that the two ingredients necessary for the application of the Section 23, as propounded in Sudesh Chhikara v. Ramti Devi, (2022 INSC 1257), i.e., the transfer should have a condition attached to it regarding maintenance and basic needs, and the transferee has failed to provide such amenities and physical needs to the transferor, were fulfilled in the present case. The Supreme Court thus held that both documents had a condition of maintenance of the mother by the son, which was not honored (¶¶ 20-23).The Supreme Court held that the purpose of the Act is to provide speedy, simple, and inexpensive remedies for the elderly, and therefore the authorities under the Section 23 of the Act have the power to order eviction and grant possession of the property to the concerned senior citizens (¶24).Prepared By: Rudrakshi Sharma (Intern) Centre for Research and Planning, Supreme Court of India"
