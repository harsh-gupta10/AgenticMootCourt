"CRPC","What is the purpose of Section 3 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973?","Section 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, serves as an interpretation clause. Its purpose is to clarify how references to different classes of Magistrates (e.g., Magistrate of the first class, Magistrate of the second class) made in the CrPC or any other law should be understood and applied, especially distinguishing between metropolitan areas (where Metropolitan Magistrates operate) and other areas (where Judicial Magistrates operate). This ensures that legal provisions are applied correctly regardless of the specific judicial designations used locally.","Construction of references","6.921464794211712e-232","0.0579710136609956","0.0","0.0579710136609956","0.568257212638855"

"CRPC","What is regulated under Section 4 in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973?","Section 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, regulates the trial of offences. 1.  Offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC): It mandates that all offences defined under the IPC must be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise handled according to the procedures laid out in the CrPC. 2.  Offences under Other Laws: For offences defined under any law other than the IPC, Section 4 states that they too shall be investigated, inquired into, tried, and handled according to the CrPC, unless the specific law under which the offence falls provides its own distinct procedure for dealing with such offences. In essence, CrPC is the default procedural code, but special laws can override its provisions with their own specific procedures.","Trial of offences under the Indian Penal Code and other laws","0.04320989630107445","0.2197802176548726","0.08547008390678648","0.19780219567685065","0.7690076231956482"
