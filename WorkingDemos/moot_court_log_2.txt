Petitioner: May it please your Lordship, the counsel seeks permission to approach the dais.


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.
Good morning, your Lordship. The counsel recognizes the gracious presence of this Hon’ble Court. For the convenience of these proceedings, may the counsel refer to your Lordship as such?


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: The counsel is appearing before this Hon’ble Court in the matter of PQR & Ors. v. State of Mahadpur, under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, challenging the constitutionality of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976 as amended on 4th November 2016.

Your Lordship, the present matter raises the following critical issues for determination:

Whether the amendment to the MPA Act, 1976 violates the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g), 21, 25, and 29 of the Constitution of India.

Whether the reverse burden of proof under Section 9-B of the amended Act is violative of the principle of presumption of innocence under Article 21.

The counsel shall now proceed to address these issues, if your Lordship so permits.


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.
Your Lordship, the brief facts of the case are as follows:

The State of Mahadpur, by an amendment dated 4th November 2016, brought changes to the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976. This amendment introduced Sections 5A to 5D, which effectively imposed a total ban on the transportation, slaughter, import, and possession of flesh of cows, bulls, and bullocks, including those slaughtered outside the State of Mahadpur.

Additionally, Sections 9A and 9B of the amendment introduced a statutory reversal of the burden of proof—placing the onus on the accused to prove that the possession or movement of such flesh was not in contravention of the Act.

These amendments were notified in the Mahadpur Gazette on 4th November 2016 and received Presidential assent on the same day.

Following the enactment, a significant section of the public, including slaughterhouse owners, expressed concern over the sweeping nature of the ban. This led to the filing of a Public Interest Litigation by the lead petitioner, PQR, along with a Writ Petition filed by the Slaughter Houses Association before the Hon’ble High Court, challenging the constitutional validity of the amended provisions.

The Hon’ble High Court upheld the amendments. The Petitioners now approach this Hon’ble Court under Article 136, challenging that judgment on the grounds that the amended Act violates fundamental rights.

If your Lordship is well-acquainted with the facts, the counsel seeks permission to proceed with the arguments.


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the first issue pertains to the constitutional validity of the amended provisions of the MPA Act, 1976—specifically Sections 5A to 5D and Section 9B—in light of Articles 21, 19(1)(g), 25, and 29 of the Constitution.
Your Lordship, Article 21 guarantees not just life, but a life with dignity. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India has recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21. This includes decisional autonomy and personal dietary choices.

The impugned provisions, by criminalizing even the possession of beef brought from outside the State, enter the private sphere of individual autonomy and disrupt personal choices, including those made in the privacy of one's home.

In effect, the law compels conformity with a specific dietary standard—not on grounds of public health, but on moral and cultural lines—without offering a legitimate state interest strong enough to override individual liberty.



Judge: : Counsel, you invoke the right to privacy under Article 21, encompassing dietary choice. How should this Court balance this individual right against the State's constitutional duty outlined in Article 48 of the Directive Principles, which directs the State to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves? Can the State impose restrictions based on these principles, even if they impact personal food choices?

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the Directive Principles, including Article 48, certainly reflect the moral and constitutional vision of our polity, and the State may rely on them to justify certain restrictions. However, when such restrictions infringe a Fundamental Right, such as the right to privacy under Article 21, the test of proportionality and necessity must still be satisfied.

As held in Puttaswamy, individual autonomy in personal spaces—including food choices—falls squarely within the right to privacy. The State cannot override this right solely on moral or ideological grounds unless it demonstrates a compelling public interest, and that the restriction is the least intrusive means to achieve that interest.


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the total ban, especially as it applies to slaughterhouse owners and meat traders, directly impairs the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.

While reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6) are permissible, the totality of the ban—extending to even inter-State movement and lawful possession—fails the test of proportionality. The counsel submits that less restrictive alternatives could have served the same purpose.

The Hon’ble Court in Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar upheld bans on cow slaughter only where it was balanced by public interest and did not impose undue hardship on the livelihoods of butchers. Here, even animals lawfully slaughtered in other States fall within the prohibition—a restriction that appears excessive and arbitrary.


Judge: : Counsel, you contend that less restrictive alternatives could have achieved the State's objectives. Could you elaborate on what specific, less restrictive measures you believe would be constitutionally permissible while still addressing the State's purported interests under Article 48, particularly concerning the trade and possession aspects challenged under Article 19(1)(g)?

Petitioner: ChatGPT said:
Your Lordship, the Petitioners submit that the State’s objectives under Article 48—preserving cattle and preventing slaughter—can indeed be pursued through less restrictive alternatives that do not disproportionately infringe the rights under Article 19(1)(g).

Specifically:

Enhanced Licensing and Inspection of Slaughterhouses: Instead of a blanket ban, the State could regulate slaughterhouses more rigorously to ensure that only permissible animals are slaughtered, thereby aligning with Article 48 without eliminating livelihoods.

Inter-State Certification System: For trade and possession of beef sourced from outside Mahadpur, the State could require certification mechanisms, like veterinary clearance, transport permits, or origin verification. This would allow legal trade without violating interstate commerce or creating an undue burden on individual rights.


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the Constitution guarantees the freedom to practice and propagate religion under Article 25 and the protection of distinct cultural identities under Article 29.

For certain communities, consumption of beef is not just a dietary preference but an element of culture and belief. The impugned provisions ignore this diversity and impose a uniform norm derived from majoritarian sentiment. Such uniformity, when enforced by law, stands at odds with the pluralistic ethos of the Constitution.

The Hon’ble Court has previously held in Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala that freedom of conscience is not subject to popular morality but to constitutional morality. Hence, religious or cultural practices of minority communities must be given equal protection.


Judge: : Counsel, you argue that the ban infringes upon Articles 25 and 29 by affecting communities for whom beef consumption is part of their culture or belief. Could you elaborate on whether this consumption constitutes an 'essential religious practice' for any specific community, a standard often required for protection under Article 25? Furthermore, how does the protection under Article 29 for cultural rights apply specifically to dietary practices in this context, especially when weighed against the State's objectives under Article 48?

Petitioner: Your Lordship, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify.

On Article 25:
The Petitioners acknowledge that to receive full protection under Article 25, a practice must be shown to be essential to a religion. While beef consumption may not qualify as an essential religious practice in the strict doctrinal sense for most communities, the freedom of conscience and belief protected under Article 25(1) is broader. As held in Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, what matters is whether a practice stems from a sincere belief, even if not mandated by religious texts. Hence, the protection can extend to dietary practices arising from deeply held convictions tied to faith or identity.

On Article 29:
This provision safeguards the distinct culture of minority groups, including dietary habits as cultural expressions. For certain Scheduled Tribes, Dalit communities, and religious minorities, beef consumption is embedded in tradition, not merely as food but as a marker of cultural autonomy. The impugned law disproportionately targets such communities, amounting to cultural homogenization, contrary to the spirit of Article 29.

Thus, even if beef consumption is not an "essential religious practice," the cumulative impact on both conscience and culture merits constitutional scrutiny—especially when balanced against Article 48, which, while significant, is a Directive Principle and not a fundamental right. The disproportionate burden imposed on marginalized groups cannot be justified merely on grounds of a majoritarian ethical stance.


Judge: : `<None>`

Petitioner: In light of the above submissions, your Lordship, the amended provisions of the MPA Act, 1976 suffer from unconstitutionality on multiple fronts. They are arbitrary, disproportionate, and incompatible with the values enshrined in Articles 19, 21, 25, and 29 of the Constitution.

The counsel humbly prays that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to strike down Sections 5A to 5D and Section 9B of the Act as being ultra vires the Constitution.

Should your Lordship have any questions or require clarifications, the counsel shall be pleased to address them.


Judge: : `<None>`
The respondent's arguments will now begin.

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: : May it please Your Lordships. I appear on behalf of the Respondent, the State of Mahadpur, in the Special Leave Petition filed by PQR & Ors. With Your Lordships' permission, I shall proceed with the submissions on behalf of the Respondent.

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: : Your Lordships, this matter arises from a Special Leave Petition filed under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, challenging the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court of Mahadpur which upheld the constitutional validity of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2016, specifically Sections 5A to 5D and Sections 9A and 9B thereof. The Respondent State submits to the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. May I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to the Statement of Issues?

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: : Your Lordships, the Respondent humbly submits that the core issues for consideration before this Hon'ble Court are as follows:

    1.  Whether the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2016, particularly Sections 5A to 5D, constitutes a reasonable restriction on the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution, enacted in furtherance of the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, and Fundamental Duties under Article 51A(g)?
    2.  Whether Section 5D, prohibiting possession of flesh of cows, bulls, or bullocks slaughtered outside Mahadpur, infringes upon the Right to Privacy under Article 21, considering the nature of the restriction and the compelling public interest sought to be achieved?
    3.  Whether Section 9B, which shifts the burden of proof onto the accused under specific circumstances, is constitutionally valid and does not violate Article 21, viewed in the context of regulatory statutes aimed at preventing specific offences?
    4.  Whether the impugned amendments infringe upon the Petitioners' rights under Article 25 and Article 29 of the Constitution?

    With Your Lordships' permission, may I proceed to the arguments defending the constitutionality of the impugned provisions?

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: Agent stopped due to max iterations.

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: :

Your Lordships, addressing the first issue, the Respondent submits that the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2016, represents a valid exercise of legislative power aimed at fulfilling the constitutional mandate enshrined in the Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties.

Specifically, Article 48 of the Constitution directs the State to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and to take steps for preserving and improving breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle. The impugned amendments, particularly Sections 5A to 5D imposing restrictions on slaughter, transport, and possession, are directly in furtherance of this constitutional directive.

Furthermore, Article 51A(g) casts a fundamental duty upon every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures. The Act seeks to cultivate this sense of compassion and prevent cruelty to animals specified therein.

It is a settled principle, Your Lordships, that Fundamental Rights under Part III must be read harmoniously with the Directive Principles in Part IV and the Fundamental Duties in Part IVA. While the Petitioners invoke Articles 19(1)(g) and 21, these rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the public interest. Restrictions enacted to give effect to Directive Principles are generally considered reasonable and in the public interest. The economic, agricultural, and cultural significance of cattle in the state, coupled with the constitutional directives, provides a compelling public interest justifying the restrictions imposed by the amendments.

Therefore, the Respondent contends that the limitations imposed by Sections 5A to 5D are reasonable restrictions, protected under Article 19(6) and the inherent limitations within Article 21, enacted to achieve the laudable objectives outlined in Articles 48 and 51A(g).

May I proceed to elaborate on the reasonableness of these restrictions in light of judicial precedents, Your Lordships?

Judge: : Counsel, you rely on Article 48, which directs the State to prohibit the slaughter of cows, calves, and other milch and draught cattle. How does extending the prohibition to the mere possession of beef, even if sourced from animals lawfully slaughtered outside Mahadpur (as per Section 5D), directly further the objective outlined in Article 48? Isn't the act targeted by Article 48 the slaughter itself, which has already occurred elsewhere in such cases?

Respondent: :

Your Lordship raises a pertinent point regarding the nexus between Section 5D and the objectives of Article 48. The Respondent submits that the prohibition on possession under Section 5D, even concerning flesh from animals lawfully slaughtered outside Mahadpur, is an essential ancillary measure necessary for the effective implementation and enforcement of the primary prohibition on slaughter within the State, which is directly mandated by Article 48.

If the possession of such beef were permitted within Mahadpur, it would create a significant practical impediment to enforcing the ban on slaughter within the State. It would become extremely difficult, if not impossible, for enforcement authorities to differentiate between beef originating from animals slaughtered legally outside the State and beef from animals slaughtered illegally inside Mahadpur in contravention of the Act. This difficulty would render the State's prohibition on slaughter, enacted pursuant to Article 48, largely ineffective and easily circumvented.

Furthermore, allowing the possession and consumption of beef sourced from outside would sustain the demand for such products within the State. This demand could indirectly encourage the slaughter of cattle in neighbouring areas specifically for import into Mahadpur, thereby undermining the legislative intent to give effect to the spirit of Article 48 within the State's sphere of influence.

Therefore, Your Lordship, Section 5D is not aimed at extraterritorially prohibiting slaughter that has already occurred elsewhere. Rather, it is a necessary supporting provision designed to prevent the frustration of the Act's core objective – the prohibition of slaughter of specified cattle within Mahadpur – by closing a potential loophole that would otherwise render the primary ban unenforceable. It is a measure enacted to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the legislative scheme implementing the Directive Principle under Article 48.

If Your Lordship has any further questions on this point, I am prepared to address them. Otherwise, may I, with Your Lordship's permission, proceed with further submissions on the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned amendments?

Judge: : Counsel, you assert that differentiating legally imported beef from illegally slaughtered beef within the state is 'extremely difficult, if not impossible,' thus justifying the possession ban under Section 5D for effective enforcement. Was any evidence considered or feasibility study conducted to support this claim of impossibility? Could a stringent regulatory regime involving tagging, certification, and point-of-sale checks not address this enforcement challenge without resorting to a complete ban on possession?

Respondent: : Your Lordship, I acknowledge the pertinent questions raised regarding the basis for the assertion of difficulty in differentiation and the feasibility of alternative regulatory mechanisms.

Regarding the first point, concerning evidence or a formal feasibility study on the difficulty of distinguishing legally imported beef from that sourced from illegal slaughter within Mahadpur: While the legislative record may not explicitly detail a specific, commissioned 'feasibility study' in those exact terms, the legislature, in its wisdom and based on its understanding of the ground realities and administrative challenges within the State, concluded that such differentiation would be fraught with practical impossibilities. The nature of meat products makes their origin difficult to trace definitively once they enter the supply chain. The potential for misdeclaration, the difficulty in verifying documentation accompanying consignments (especially from numerous sources outside the state), and the challenges in policing numerous points of sale and possession across the state were factors inherently considered. The legislature is presumed to act based on a reasonable assessment of prevailing conditions and the practicalities of enforcement. The sheer scale required for foolproof monitoring led to the legislative judgment that differentiating would be administratively unviable and prone to abuse, thereby undermining the core prohibition.

Addressing Your Lordship's second point, on the potential sufficiency of a stringent regulatory regime involving tagging, certification, and checks: The State submits that while such measures are employed in other contexts, the legislature apprehended that they would be insufficient to guarantee the effective enforcement of the slaughter ban under the Mahadpur Act. Implementing and enforcing a foolproof system of tagging and certification for meat imported from potentially numerous jurisdictions, tracking it through transit, processing, and down to the final point of sale or consumption, presents enormous logistical and administrative challenges. Such systems are susceptible to forgery, corruption, and gaps in enforcement, particularly given the nature of the product and the potential for clandestine activities. The legislature determined that the risk of such a regime failing to prevent the commingling of legal and illegal products, and thus failing to effectively enforce the ban on slaughter within the state (the primary objective linked to Article 48), was unacceptably high. Therefore, the prohibition on possession under Section 5D was deemed a necessary ancillary measure to ensure the primary legislative intent was not rendered ineffective. It represents the legislature's chosen method, within its wide latitude, to address a complex enforcement problem directly linked to achieving a constitutionally directed objective.

Unless Your Lordship has further inquiries on this specific point, may I seek permission to proceed with the submissions regarding the reasonableness of the restrictions in light of judicial precedents?

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: : Your Lordships, having addressed the concerns regarding the necessity of Section 5D for effective enforcement and the perceived limitations of alternative regulatory regimes, the Respondent reiterates that the legislature acted within its competence and wisdom to ensure the primary objective of the Act, rooted in Article 48, is not frustrated.

Unless Your Lordships have further questions on this aspect, may I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to cite judicial precedents that support the Respondent's contention regarding the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2016, particularly in the context of balancing Fundamental Rights with Directive Principles of State Policy?

Judge: : Counsel, you've argued that Section 5D's complete ban on possession is necessary for the effective enforcement of the slaughter prohibition under Article 48, deeming alternatives impractical. However, considering this measure completely extinguishes the right to possess and consume even legally sourced beef, impacting rights under Article 21 and potentially Article 19(1)(g), how does the State demonstrate that this absolute prohibition meets the stringent test of proportionality required when restricting fundamental rights, particularly when balancing them against Directive Principles?

Respondent: Your Lordship, the Respondent acknowledges the gravity of the restriction imposed by Section 5D and its impact on the rights invoked by the Petitioners under Articles 21 and 19(1)(g). However, the Respondent submits that this measure satisfies the stringent test of proportionality when viewed in the context of the compelling state interest derived directly from the Directive Principles of State Policy.

The proportionality analysis, as established by this Hon'ble Court, involves assessing: (i) the legitimacy of the state's objective, (ii) the rational connection between the measure and the objective, (iii) the necessity of the measure (i.e., whether less intrusive alternatives exist that are equally effective), and (iv) the balancing of the restriction's severity against the importance of the objective.

1.  Legitimate Objective: As previously submitted, the objective is to give effect to Article 48 of the Constitution, which mandates the prohibition of slaughter of specific cattle, and Article 51A(g), promoting compassion for living creatures. These are constitutionally sanctioned, fundamental goals in the governance of the country.
2.  Rational Nexus: The ban on possession under Section 5D is rationally connected to preventing the circumvention of the intra-state slaughter ban. It directly addresses the enforcement challenge of distinguishing legally sourced (imported) beef from illegally sourced beef, thereby ensuring the primary prohibition is not rendered ineffective.
3.  Necessity: Your Lordship, we have addressed the perceived impracticality and insufficiency of alternative measures like tagging or certification. The legislature, in its assessment, concluded that only a prohibition on possession could effectively close the loophole and guarantee the enforcement of the slaughter ban within Mahadpur. A less restrictive measure was not deemed equally effective in achieving the legislative objective mandated by Article 48.
4.  Balancing (Proportionality Stricto Sensu): This stage requires balancing the adverse impact on fundamental rights against the significance of the public interest served. While the restriction impacts the choice of food under Article 21 and potentially the trade related to imported beef under Article 19(1)(g), this impact must be weighed against the constitutional imperative of Article 48. Laws enacted to implement Directive Principles carry a strong presumption of constitutionality and reasonableness. This Hon'ble Court has consistently held that individual interests under Fundamental Rights must sometimes yield to the larger public interest embodied in the Directive Principles. The right to choose one's food, while an aspect of Article 21, is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable restrictions, particularly when the restriction serves a compelling public purpose grounded in the Constitution itself, such as preventing animal cruelty and upholding the objectives of Article 48. Similarly, the restriction on trade related to imported beef is argued to be a reasonable restriction under Article 19(6) in furtherance of these objectives. The legislature has determined that the public interest in upholding the prohibition on slaughter, as directed by the Constitution, outweighs the limitation imposed on the possession of beef, even if legally sourced from outside.

Therefore, Your Lordship, the State submits that the absolute prohibition under Section 5D, while stringent, is a necessary and proportionate measure required to effectively implement the constitutional mandate under Article 48, thereby satisfying the test of proportionality.

Unless Your Lordship has further questions on the aspect of proportionality, may I seek permission to proceed with citing judicial precedents supporting the reasonableness of restrictions enacted in furtherance of Directive Principles?

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: :

Your Lordships, the Respondent is grateful for the permission to proceed.

To substantiate the argument that the restrictions imposed by the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2016, are reasonable and constitutionally valid, particularly when viewed through the lens of balancing Fundamental Rights with Directive Principles, the Respondent humbly relies on established judicial precedents.

This Hon'ble Court, in the landmark case of State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat, (2005) 8 SCC 534, extensively examined the interplay between Article 19(1)(g) and Article 48. The Court held that Directive Principles, while not directly enforceable, are fundamental in the governance of the country and must guide the State in making laws. It was emphatically stated that restrictions imposed in furtherance of Article 48 carry a strong presumption of reasonableness.

In Mirzapur, this Hon'ble Court upheld the constitutional validity of an amendment imposing a total prohibition on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks, irrespective of their age or usefulness, thereby giving precedence to the objectives of Article 48. The Court observed that the objective of Article 48 is not merely to preserve cattle useful for agriculture or milch purposes but extends to the preservation of the species itself, recognizing their continued utility (e.g., for dung) even after they cease to be draught animals.

The Respondent submits that the Mahadpur High Court, in upholding the impugned amendments, correctly applied the principles laid down in Mirzapur. The amendments, including the prohibition on slaughter (Sections 5A-C) and the ancillary provision regarding possession (Section 5D) necessary for effective enforcement, are directly aimed at achieving the objectives of Article 48, as interpreted by this Hon'ble Court. The rationale in Mirzapur, which emphasizes the fundamental nature of Article 48 and the presumption of reasonableness for laws enacted thereunder, squarely supports the Respondent's contention that the impugned provisions constitute reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6) and within the permissible limits of Article 21.

Unless Your Lordships have further questions on the applicability of these precedents, may I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to address the specific challenge raised by the Petitioners concerning the Right to Privacy and Choice under Article 21 in relation to Section 5D?

Judge: : Counsel, you rely significantly on the Mirzapur decision, which upheld a total ban on the slaughter of certain cattle within Gujarat, linking it to Article 48. How does the reasoning in Mirzapur specifically justify Section 5D of the Mahadpur Act, which criminalizes the mere possession of beef, even if sourced from animals lawfully slaughtered outside the State of Mahadpur, particularly when considering the Petitioner's challenge based on the right to privacy and choice under Article 21?

Respondent: :

Your Lordship, the reliance on the Mirzapur decision extends beyond merely upholding the ban on slaughter itself. The core principle established in Mirzapur is the significant weight and constitutional importance accorded to the Directive Principle enshrined in Article 48. This Hon'ble Court, in Mirzapur, recognized that achieving the objectives of Article 48 constitutes a compelling public interest that can justify substantial restrictions on fundamental rights, specifically Article 19(1)(g) in that context.

While Mirzapur dealt directly with the prohibition on slaughter within Gujarat, its reasoning provides crucial support for Section 5D of the Mahadpur Act in two ways when considering the Article 21 challenge:

1.  Validation of the Underlying Objective: Mirzapur unequivocally establishes the legitimacy and compelling nature of the State's objective in prohibiting the slaughter of specific cattle under Article 48. This objective forms the bedrock justification for the Mahadpur Act, including Section 5D.
2.  Justification for Effective Enforcement Measures: The Mirzapur decision implicitly recognizes the State's authority to enact measures necessary to effectively implement the prohibition mandated by Article 48. If the primary prohibition on slaughter within Mahadpur (Sections 5A-C) is justified based on Mirzapur's interpretation of Article 48, then ancillary provisions reasonably required to prevent the primary prohibition from being rendered ineffective – such as Section 5D's ban on possession – derive their justification from the same compelling public interest. As argued earlier, the ban on possession is deemed necessary to prevent the circumvention of the intra-state slaughter ban due to the practical impossibility of distinguishing legally imported beef from illegally slaughtered local beef.

Regarding the specific challenge under Article 21 (Right to Privacy and Choice): The right to privacy, including the right to make personal choices about food, is indeed a fundamental right. However, as established by this Hon'ble Court, it is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions based on law, legitimate state aim, and proportionality. The Mirzapur decision underscores that fulfilling the mandate of Article 48 is a legitimate and compelling state aim. Section 5D, as an essential measure to ensure the effective implementation of this aim, serves this legitimate purpose. The State contends that the restriction imposed by Section 5D, viewed in light of the Mirzapur precedent emphasizing the importance of Article 48, is a proportionate measure necessary to achieve the constitutional directive, even if it impacts the choice of food under Article 21. The legislative judgment is that the compelling interest in preventing the slaughter of specified cattle within the state, as validated by Mirzapur, outweighs the restriction on possessing beef sourced from outside.

Therefore, Your Lordship, the reasoning in Mirzapur, by affirming the constitutional significance of Article 48, provides the foundation for justifying not only the primary slaughter ban but also the necessary enforcement mechanism of Section 5D against challenges under both Article 19(1)(g) and Article 21.

Unless Your Lordship has further questions on this point or the application of Mirzapur, may I, with permission, proceed to address the challenge pertaining to Section 9B regarding the burden of proof?

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: :

Your Lordships, having addressed the challenge to Section 5D based on Article 21 and its connection to the principles laid down in State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat, the Respondent submits that the restriction, while impacting personal choice, is a necessary and proportionate measure to effectively implement the compelling state interest enshrined in Article 48 of the Constitution.

Unless Your Lordships have any further questions concerning the challenge to Sections 5A to 5D under Articles 19(1)(g) and 21, may I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to address the third issue raised by the Petitioners, namely, the challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 9B, which deals with the burden of proof, under Article 21?

Judge: : `<None>`

Respondent: :

Your Lordships, the Respondent will now address the third issue raised by the Petitioners: the challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 9B of the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals Act, 1976, as amended, under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Petitioners argue that this section, by reversing the burden of proof onto the accused, violates the presumption of innocence.

The Respondent acknowledges the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence, protected under Article 21, that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, this principle is not absolute and admits exceptions crafted by the legislature, particularly in the context of regulatory statutes aimed at curbing specific social or economic harms, or where facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused.

Section 9B does not impose an absolute burden on the accused from the outset. It operates only after the prosecution discharges its initial burden of establishing foundational facts, such as the possession, transport, or sale of the specified animal flesh by the accused. Once these facts are established, Section 9B creates a rebuttable presumption, requiring the accused to furnish proof regarding the legality of their actions (e.g., that the slaughter did not occur within Mahadpur in contravention of the Act, or that the transport or possession is otherwise lawful under the Act).

This procedural shift is justified, Your Lordships, by the inherent difficulty the prosecution would face in proving a negative – namely, that the meat was not sourced legally according to the Act's provisions. The facts concerning the origin, slaughter, and transport of the specific meat are typically within the special knowledge of the person possessing or dealing with it. Requiring the accused to provide evidence on these matters, which they are best placed to possess, is a necessary tool for the effective enforcement of the Act's prohibitions.

This Hon'ble Court has previously upheld the validity of similar reverse onus clauses in various statutes dealing with socio-economic offences, provided they are reasonable and not arbitrary. Such provisions are recognized as permissible legislative tools to ensure the efficacy of regulatory measures enacted in the public interest. Section 9B is precisely such a measure, designed to prevent the substantive provisions of the Act, aimed at fulfilling the mandate of Article 48, from being easily evaded due to insurmountable proof challenges for the prosecution. It is a reasonable procedural requirement and does not violate the essence of Article 21.

Unless Your Lordships have any questions regarding the constitutionality of Section 9B, may I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to address the final issue raised by the Petitioners concerning the alleged violation of Articles 25 and 29 of the Constitution?

Judge: : Counsel, you argue that Section 9B operates only after the prosecution establishes foundational facts like possession, and the burden shifts because the origin details are within the accused's 'special knowledge'. However, if someone possesses meat purchased from a vendor, how is the origin and legality of slaughter (which might have occurred far away, involving multiple intermediaries) considered 'peculiarly' within the knowledge of the end possessor? Does this application of reverse onus not place an unreasonable burden, potentially violating Article 21?

Respondent: : Your Lordship raises a critical point regarding the application of the 'special knowledge' principle to an end possessor, particularly one who has purchased meat from a vendor, and the potential unreasonableness under Article 21.

The Respondent submits that while the degree of direct knowledge about the ultimate origin and legality of slaughter may vary depending on the accused's position in the supply chain, Section 9B is designed as a necessary enforcement mechanism for a regulatory statute aimed at preventing a specific harm prohibited under the Act, which itself is grounded in Article 48.

1.  Scope of 'Special Knowledge': For an end possessor who purchased from a vendor, the 'special knowledge' under Section 106 of the Evidence Act, in the context of Section 9B, pertains primarily to the circumstances of their acquisition of the meat. They have peculiar knowledge of from whom they purchased it, when, and under what circumstances. While they may not know the precise origin or slaughter details, they possess the immediate knowledge regarding their own transaction.
2.  Rebuttable Presumption: Section 9B creates a rebuttable presumption, not an insurmountable burden. The nature and quantum of proof required from the accused to rebut the presumption would necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances, including their role. An end consumer might discharge their burden by demonstrating, for instance, a purchase made in good faith from a licensed vendor (if such licensing exists) or providing details of the seller, thereby furnishing a starting point for further investigation if needed. The provision does not necessarily require the end consumer to trace the meat back to its origin definitively.
3.  Regulatory Context: In regulatory offences, particularly those involving prohibited items or substances where tracing origin is difficult for the prosecution, the legislature often places a degree of onus on those dealing with or possessing the item. This encourages diligence and aids effective enforcement. The objective is to ensure the Act's prohibitions (like the ban on possession linked to the intra-state slaughter ban) are not easily defeated by the practical difficulties of proving the negative (i.e., proving the meat was from an animal illegally slaughtered within Mahadpur).
4.  Proportionality and Article 21: The Respondent contends that this procedural requirement, viewed in the context of the Act's objectives and the enforcement challenges, is a proportionate legislative measure. It does not render the presumption of innocence illusory but shifts the onus of introducing evidence on facts peculiarly within the accused's knowledge regarding their possession. The difficulty highlighted by Your Lordship is acknowledged, but the legislature deemed this shift necessary for the efficacy of the law enacted in furtherance of a Directive Principle. The burden is not absolute and must be applied reasonably by the courts, considering the accused's specific situation. Therefore, it does not place an unreasonable burden violating Article 21.

Unless Your Lordship has further questions on the operation or constitutionality of Section 9B, may I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to address the final issue raised by the Petitioners concerning the alleged violation of Articles 25 and 29 of the Constitution?

Respondent: :

Your Lordships, the Respondent is grateful for the opportunity to address the final issue raised by the Petitioners: the contention that the Mahadpur Preservation of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2016, infringes upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 25 (Right to Freedom of Religion) and Article 29 (Cultural Rights) of the Constitution.

The Respondent submits that this challenge is misconceived and lacks merit. The impugned Act is, in its essence and purpose, a legislation aimed at giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy, specifically Article 48, concerning the preservation and improvement of cattle breeds and prohibiting their slaughter. It is primarily an economic and regulatory measure, also reflecting the Fundamental Duty under Article 51A(g) to show compassion to living creatures.

With respect to Article 25, this Hon'ble Court has consistently held that the protection afforded is to practices that are essential and integral to a religion. In the landmark case of Mohd. Hanif Quareshi & Ors. v. The State of Bihar (AIR 1958 SC 731), this Court specifically examined whether the sacrifice of cows on Bakr-Id was an essential religious practice for Muslims and concluded that it was not. The Court found that while the religion might permit such sacrifice, it was not obligatory or essential. The impugned Mahadpur Act regulates the slaughter, possession, and transport of specific cattle based on the constitutional mandate under Article 48, which is a secular objective. It does not target any specific religious practice, much less an essential one. Any incidental effect the Act might have on the practices of any community does not render it violative of Article 25, as the primary object of the law is secular and grounded in constitutional directives.

Regarding Article 29, which protects the cultural rights of minorities, the Petitioners have failed to establish that the consumption of beef constitutes a fundamental tenet of any distinct culture protected under this Article, such that its prohibition would violate their cultural rights. The Act applies uniformly to all citizens within the State of Mahadpur and is based on considerations of animal preservation and public interest as mandated by the Constitution, not on cultural grounds.

Therefore, Your Lordships, the Respondent submits that the impugned amendments do not violate either Article 25 or Article 29 of the Constitution.

Unless Your Lordships have any further questions on this issue, may I, with Your Lordships' permission, proceed to the conclusion and final prayer?
