Petitioner: May it please your Lordship, the counsel seeks permission to approach the dais.


Judge: <None>

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.Good morning, your Lordship. The counsel recognizes the gracious presence of this Hon’ble Court. For the convenience of these proceedings, may the counsel refer to your Lordship as such?


Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.The counsel is appearing before this Hon’ble Court in the matter of ALERT INDIVA v. State of BRAMHA and Others, on behalf of the Petitioner, ALERT INDIVA, an environmental NGO, invoking the writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of Indiva.



Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, this matter raises six important constitutional and environmental issues. With your Lordship’s permission, the counsel shall focus today on three foundational issues:

Whether the present petition qualifies as a Public Interest Litigation.

Whether the displacement of agriculturists amounts to a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution.

Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted is contrary to constitutional mandates.

The counsel shall address these issues for the next ten minutes and shall reserve a couple of minutes for clarification, if your Lordship deems fit.


Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, with your kind permission, the counsel shall briefly outline the facts.

The State of BRAMHA, facing severe water scarcity, has decided to construct several dams, one of which threatens to displace villagers from ten agriculturally dependent villages. The dam, sanctioned without adequate environmental and social safeguards, will submerge large tracts of cultivable land, directly impacting the livelihood and ecology of the area.

ALERT INDIVA has filed this petition on two grounds: (1) The environmental clearance was granted arbitrarily, and (2) the displacement violates the villagers' fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of Indiva.

If your Lordship is well-versed with the facts, the counsel seeks permission to proceed directly to the arguments.


Judge: Counsel, you mentioned the Environmental Clearance was granted arbitrarily. Could you briefly state the primary grounds on which you allege this arbitrariness before proceeding with detailed arguments?

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.

The allegation of arbitrariness in the grant of Environmental Clearance rests primarily on the following three grounds:

Lack of Proper Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA):
The clearance was granted without conducting a comprehensive EIA as mandated by statutory guidelines. The study submitted was generic, outdated, and failed to assess the impact on local biodiversity, forest cover, and agricultural productivity in the ten affected villages.

Absence of Public Consultation:
Your Lordship, there was no genuine public hearing or informed consent of the affected communities, which is a mandatory procedural safeguard under the EIA Notification framework. The villagers were neither informed in a language they understand nor provided adequate opportunity to raise objections.

Non-Application of Judicially Mandated Precautionary Principles:
The approving authority failed to consider less destructive alternatives, did not apply the Precautionary Principle, and approved the project despite glaring data gaps — a direct contravention of the guidelines laid down in Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India.

With your Lordship’s leave, the counsel shall now elaborate on these grounds under Issue 3 of the submissions.


Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the petition is maintainable as a Public Interest Litigation as the petitioner NGO, ALERT INDIVA, has no personal interest but seeks to protect the rights of displaced agriculturists and the ecological balance of the region.

In Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary, (1992) 4 SCC 305, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that public interest litigation is maintainable where a third party represents those who cannot approach the court themselves due to poverty, illiteracy, or social disadvantage.



Judge: The Janata Dal case mentions representing those unable to approach the court due to poverty, illiteracy, or social disadvantage. What specific evidence supports the claim that the affected villagers in these ten villages fall into this category and cannot approach the court directly themselves?

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.

The affected villagers are primarily small-scale farmers from economically backward areas, with official data showing below-poverty-line status and low literacy rates. They lack access to legal resources, awareness of their constitutional rights, and means to approach this Hon’ble Court.

No proper legal aid or rehabilitation plan has been communicated to them, making it impractical for them to initiate proceedings on their own. Therefore, as held in Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary and PUDR v. Union of India, this petition is a genuine exercise in public interest, enabling access to justice for the disadvantaged.


Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the construction of the dam, which will displace agriculturists and submerge their cultivable lands without a clear rehabilitation plan, amounts to a violation of their right to life and livelihood under Article 21.

In Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation, AIR 1986 SC 180, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the “right to livelihood is an integral part of the right to life.” By displacing villagers without adequate compensation, the state is extinguishing their very means of existence.

The counsel respectfully submits that the doctrine of “life with dignity” laid down in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597, stands violated here as no amount of economic or industrial gain can override the constitutional protection of basic human rights.


Judge: Counsel, you emphasize the lack of a clear rehabilitation plan and adequate compensation as central to the Article 21 violation. Has the State proposed any specific resettlement or compensation measures for the displaced villagers? If so, on what grounds do you contend these measures are insufficient to meet the constitutional standard of 'right to life with dignity'?

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.

The State has indeed alluded to monetary compensation and relocation packages. However, these measures are vague, lack transparency, and have not been meaningfully communicated or tailored to the socio-economic realities of the affected agriculturists.


Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: Your Lordship, the Environment Clearance Certificate granted to Reliable Industries Limited was approved in haste, with no proper Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study or public consultation with affected parties.

In Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum v. Union of India, (1996) 5 SCC 647, the Hon’ble Supreme Court emphasized the "Precautionary Principle" and "Polluter Pays Principle" as part of environmental law under Article 21.


Judge: Regarding the Precautionary Principle cited from Vellore Citizens, how do you contend it should have been applied differently by the authorities, especially considering the stated public interest goal of addressing severe water scarcity?

Petitioner: Much obliged, your Lordship.

The Precautionary Principle, as affirmed in Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum v. Union of India, requires that if there is a threat of serious environmental damage, lack of scientific certainty shall not be a reason to postpone preventive measures. The burden lies on the developer or State to demonstrate that the proposed project is environmentally benign.

In the present case, Your Lordship, while the State cites public interest due to water scarcity, the Environmental Clearance was granted without a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment, particularly ignoring:

Cumulative ecological impact on the ten villages, biodiversity, and water-logging consequences.

No public consultation with local stakeholders, despite the mandate under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006.

No scientific data showing mitigation of adverse effects like displacement-induced degradation or groundwater imbalance.

Hence, Your Lordship, the Precautionary Principle should have guided the authorities to halt or re-evaluate the project until such concerns were satisfactorily addressed. In failing to do so, the clearance stands arbitrary and unconstitutional.


Judge: `<None>`

Petitioner: In view of these submissions, your Lordship, the counsel humbly asserts that the current dam project violates constitutional guarantees and environmental norms. The blanket justification of "larger public interest" cannot override the specific, measurable harm to vulnerable communities and ecosystems.

The Hon’ble High Court must act as the guardian of constitutional rights and environmental justice.


Judge: Counsel, you argue that the 'larger public interest' justification is insufficient. However, the State presents the dam as a necessary policy response to severe water scarcity. What legal standard should this Court apply when balancing such a stated public necessity against the fundamental rights and environmental concerns you've raised? Where is the line drawn for judicial interference in policy decisions?

Petitioner: The counsel submits that while the doctrine of separation of powers mandates judicial restraint in policy matters, the Hon’ble Court is nevertheless empowered—and indeed duty-bound—to intervene where policy decisions transgress constitutional mandates or are patently arbitrary, unreasoned, or disproportionate.
In the instant matter, the counsel submits that:

Fundamental Right under Article 21 is at stake—not merely as a matter of livelihood, but of dignified rehabilitation and environmental security.

The State has failed to demonstrate proportionality—that the means adopted (displacement without adequate safeguards) are the least restrictive means to achieve the public goal.

No balancing exercise has been documented between the environmental costs and developmental benefits.


Petitioner: If your Lordship is satisfied with the arguments advanced, the counsel humbly prays for the following reliefs:

Quash the Environmental Clearance Certificate granted to Reliable Industries Limited as being unconstitutional and arbitrary.

Direct the State of BRAMHA to conduct a fresh environmental and social impact assessment with full public participation.

Declare that the proposed dam project, in its current form, violates Article 21 of the Constitution.

Pass any other order deemed just and proper by this Hon’ble Court in the interest of justice and equity.
It has been a privilege to argue before this Hon’ble Court.


Judge: <None>
The respondent's arguments will now begin.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, Counsel for the Respondent, the State of Bramha, seeks permission to present the submissions in the matter of Alert Indiva Vs. State of Bramha and Other.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, I appear on behalf of the Respondent, the State of Bramha, in the matter of Alert Indiva versus the State of Bramha and Other. This Hon'ble Court is seized of this matter under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of Indiva. The Respondent submits that the decision to construct the dam is a necessary policy measure undertaken in the larger public interest to combat severe water scarcity and drought conditions within the State, and that the actions taken are well within the constitutional and legal framework. With Your Lordship's permission, I shall proceed to address the issues framed by this Hon'ble Court.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the Respondent acknowledges the issues framed by this Honourable Court for adjudication in this matter. These issues are:

1.  Whether the present petition is maintainable as a Public Interest Litigation.
2.  Whether the Writ Petition filed under Art. 226 and Art. 227 is Maintainable.
3.  Whether this Honourable Court can interfere in the policy decision taken by the State of Bramha.
4.  Whether the displacement of agriculturists amounts to a violation of Art. 21.
5.  Whether the Environment Clearance Certificate granted is contrary to the Constitution.
6.  Whether the State's decision to construct the dam should be upheld or quashed.

With Your Lordship's permission, the Respondent would like to begin addressing the first issue concerning the maintainability of this petition as a Public Interest Litigation.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, Counsel for the Respondent will now address the first issue framed by this Hon'ble Court: Whether the present petition has been filed in public interest and therefore maintainable as a Public Interest Litigation?

Your Lordship, the State of Bramha acknowledges the expanded scope of locus standi under Public Interest Litigation, established through landmark cases like S.P. Gupta v. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149), which permits public-spirited citizens and organizations like 'Alert Indiva' to approach the Court on behalf of those unable to do so themselves, especially concerning fundamental rights and environmental matters.

The Respondent recognizes that the issues raised—environmental impact and the potential displacement of agriculturists—are matters of public concern. Therefore, the Respondent does not wish to contest the locus standi of the Petitioner, 'Alert Indiva', to file this petition pro bono publico.

However, the Respondent humbly submits that the determination of "public interest" in this specific case must encompass the dire situation faced by the State due to acute water scarcity and near-drought conditions. The State's decision to construct the dam is a policy measure aimed at addressing this widespread crisis, securing water for drinking, agriculture, and industry, and replenishing groundwater levels for the benefit of the entire populace. This, Your Lordship, represents a paramount public interest.

Thus, while the petition may be maintainable in form as a PIL, the Respondent contends that the substantive public interest overwhelmingly supports the State's actions. We urge this Hon'ble Court to consider this broader context when adjudicating the merits.

May I proceed to address the second issue regarding the maintainability of the Writ Petition under Articles 226 and 227, Your Lordship?

Judge: Counsel, you concede the Petitioner's locus standi for this PIL but argue the 'substantive public interest' lies with the State's need for the dam. Does the very nature of a PIL, particularly one alleging violations of Article 21 and environmental norms, not require this Court to first thoroughly examine those specific allegations before weighing them against the broader policy objectives cited by the State, even at this preliminary stage of maintainability?

Respondent: Your Lordship raises a crucial point regarding the Court's paramount duty to scrutinize alleged violations of fundamental rights and environmental norms, particularly within the framework of Public Interest Litigation. It is respectfully submitted that the Respondent State fully acknowledges the significance of the concerns raised under Article 21 and environmental regulations, and agrees that these require thorough examination by this Hon'ble Court on their merits.

However, concerning the preliminary issue of maintainability of this petition as a PIL, the Respondent submits that the assessment cannot occur in a vacuum. While the Petitioner's locus standi is conceded, the concept of 'public interest' inherently requires the Court to consider the broader context. The State's policy decision to construct the dam arises from an acute and widespread water scarcity crisis, bordering on drought, affecting a vast population within Bramha. This effort to secure water for drinking, agriculture, and industry, and to replenish groundwater levels, represents a substantial and pressing public interest in itself.

Therefore, it is submitted that a prima facie consideration of the State's objectives is necessary even at this maintainability stage, not to definitively weigh them against the Petitioner's claims, but to understand the complete picture and ascertain whether the litigation genuinely serves the larger public interest, as opposed to potentially hindering a critical state action aimed at alleviating widespread public hardship. This preliminary contextual understanding ensures the PIL mechanism is appropriately invoked, without foreclosing the detailed examination of the Petitioner's specific allegations regarding Article 21 and environmental compliance at the subsequent merits stage. We humbly contend that the State's response to the water crisis constitutes a vital aspect of the 'substantive public interest' relevant to the question of maintainability.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: Your Lordship, the Respondent acknowledges the profound importance and the Court's solemn duty to scrutinize alleged violations of fundamental rights, particularly Article 21, and environmental norms, especially within the framework of a Public Interest Litigation. The gravity of such allegations is indeed paramount.

    However, with the greatest respect, the question of maintainability, as understood through established jurisprudence following cases like S.P. Gupta, primarily concerns the locus standi of the petitioner and whether the subject matter genuinely pertains to the public interest, rather than requiring a conclusive determination on the merits of the alleged violations at this initial stage.

    The State contends that its policy decision to construct the dam, driven by the urgent need to combat widespread drought and water scarcity impacting countless citizens, constitutes a significant and prima facie public interest. The very existence of these competing concerns – the alleged infringement of rights and environmental impact on one hand, and the State's response to a large-scale public welfare crisis on the other – underscores why this matter is appropriately brought before this Hon'ble Court as a PIL.

    While the seriousness of the Petitioner's allegations concerning Article 21 and environmental norms certainly warrants this Court's thorough examination, their existence does not, in our submission, negate the maintainability of the petition itself. Both aspects fall within the broad definition of 'public interest'. A detailed balancing of these competing interests, weighing the alleged violations against the State's justification of larger public good, is, we humbly submit, a matter for the substantive hearing on the merits, once the petition's maintainability under Issue 1 is affirmed.

Judge: Counsel, you argue the State's policy objectives provide necessary context for determining maintainability, even while conceding locus standi. However, isn't the established test for PIL maintainability primarily focused on the petitioner's bona fides, the nature of the rights allegedly infringed, and whether the affected group genuinely lacks access to justice, rather than requiring a preliminary assessment of the merits or weight of the State's justification for its actions?

Respondent: Your Lordship rightly outlines the established tests for PIL maintainability, focusing on the petitioner's bona fides, the nature of the rights allegedly infringed, and the access to justice for the affected group. The State does not dispute these foundational principles.

    However, the State submits that understanding the context in which the alleged rights infringement occurs is pertinent even at the maintainability stage, particularly when assessing the 'public interest' element inherent in the PIL framework. The State's policy decision to construct the dam arises from an acute and widespread water scarcity crisis, a matter of grave public concern affecting the entire populace of Bramha.

    Acknowledging this context is not, we contend, a premature assessment of the merits or the weight of the State's justification. Rather, it provides a necessary backdrop for evaluating whether the petition, viewed holistically, genuinely serves the overall public interest. This includes considering the State's constitutional and statutory duty to act in the face of a natural crisis impacting the fundamental well-being of its citizens. It helps frame the scope of the 'public interest' that this Hon'ble Court is being asked to adjudicate upon when determining maintainability.

    Therefore, while the petitioner's locus standi based on representing affected groups and environmental concerns is conceded for the purpose of argument, the State contends that the profound public interest served by its policy aimed at alleviating widespread drought is a relevant factor for this Hon'ble Court to consider when assessing the overall maintainability of this Public Interest Litigation.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: 

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: "Your Lordship, the Respondent acknowledges the established principles governing the maintainability of Public Interest Litigations, focusing on the petitioner's locus standi, the nature of the rights allegedly infringed, and the access to justice for the affected group. While the Respondent concedes that an organization like 'Alert Indiva' generally possesses the locus standi to bring forth matters of environmental concern and potential rights violations under the expanded scope of PIL jurisprudence, we humbly submit that the assessment of 'public interest' cannot be entirely divorced from the compelling circumstances necessitating the State's actions – namely, the severe drought and the urgent need for water resource management for the benefit of the entire populace of Bramha.

Therefore, while we concede that the petition may be technically maintainable as a PIL based on the petitioner's standing, we urge this Hon'ble Court to consider the overwhelming public interest served by the State's policy throughout the proceedings.

May it please Your Lordship, with the Court's permission, the Respondent would now like to proceed to address the second issue framed for adjudication: Whether the Writ Petition filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of Indiva is Maintainable?"

Judge: Counsel, having conceded that the petition is technically maintainable as a PIL under Issue 1, how do you propose this Court should approach the balancing exercise between the public interest represented by the Petitioner (environmental protection, rights of villagers) and the public interest claimed by the State (water scarcity alleviation) when adjudicating the substantive merits under Issues 3, 4, 5, and 6?

Respondent:

Judge: Counsel, having conceded the petition's maintainability as a Public Interest Litigation under Issue 1, which typically invokes Article 226, on what specific grounds do you intend to challenge the maintainability of the writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 as a separate issue (Issue 2)? What distinction are you drawing between the maintainability arguments under these two issues in this specific case?

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship, the Respondent appreciates the opportunity to clarify the distinction between our submissions on Issue 1 and Issue 2 regarding maintainability.

Your Lordship, while the Respondent has conceded, for the sake of argument, the locus standi of the Petitioner 'Alert Indiva' to file this petition as a Public Interest Litigation under Issue 1 – acknowledging the broadened scope established in PIL jurisprudence allowing representative bodies to approach the court on matters of public importance, particularly concerning environmental issues and fundamental rights – our challenge under Issue 2 pertains to different, albeit related, grounds concerning the maintainability of the writ petition itself under the specific heads of Articles 226 and 227.

The distinction, Your Lordship, lies herein:
1.  Issue 1 (PIL Maintainability): This primarily concerned the standing of the Petitioner – whether an NGO like 'Alert Indiva' could legitimately represent the public interest and the interests of the affected villagers. We have conceded this point based on precedents like S.P. Gupta.
2.  Issue 2 (Writ Maintainability under Art. 226 & 227): This issue challenges the appropriateness and entertainability of the writ remedy sought, irrespective of the Petitioner's standing. Our grounds under Issue 2, which we intend to elaborate upon, may include, inter alia:
       The existence of alternative and efficacious remedies that the Petitioner ought to have pursued before invoking the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court, potentially through specialized tribunals or statutory bodies dealing with environmental clearances or rehabilitation.
       The nature of the impugned actions – namely, a policy decision taken in response to a state-wide crisis and the grant of environmental clearance based on expert assessment. While not immune from judicial review, the scope of interference under Article 226, particularly concerning policy matters and technical assessments, is circumscribed and requires examination.
       The specific invocation of Article 227, which confers supervisory jurisdiction, may not be appropriate against the executive actions challenged herein, as its scope is generally directed towards inferior courts and tribunals.

Therefore, Your Lordship, Issue 1 dealt with who can approach the Court in the public interest, which we conceded. Issue 2 deals with whether the writ jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 is the appropriate remedy to be invoked in the facts and circumstances of this case, considering potential alternative remedies and the specific nature of the executive actions being challenged. We submit that these are distinct legal considerations pertinent to the maintainability of the petition before this Hon'ble Court.

With Your Lordship's permission, I shall await further direction on whether to elaborate on these grounds now or proceed as per the Court's preference.

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: "Your Lordship, the distinction the Respondent draws is as follows:

    Issue 1 concerned the locus standi of the Petitioner, 'Alert Indiva', to bring this matter before the Court as a Public Interest Litigation. As Your Lordship noted, we conceded that based on the established principles broadening access to justice in PIL matters, particularly concerning environmental issues and the rights of potentially disadvantaged groups like the agriculturists, the Petitioner has the standing to file this petition in the public interest.

    Issue 2, however, addresses a different aspect: the maintainability and appropriateness of invoking the High Court's extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 specifically against the actions challenged – namely, a policy decision of the State government and the grant of an Environmental Clearance.

    Under Article 226, while the Court's power is wide, its exercise is discretionary. We intend to argue that the nature of the challenge, involving complex policy considerations regarding resource management in a drought situation and technical environmental assessments, might make the Court hesitant to interfere via a writ, potentially favouring other avenues or requiring a higher threshold for intervention.

    Furthermore, Article 227 primarily confers powers of superintendence over subordinate courts and tribunals. We submit that challenging a State policy decision or an environmental clearance granted by the executive does not typically fall within the conventional scope of Article 227's supervisory jurisdiction, which is distinct from the broader power under Article 226 to issue writs against 'any person or authority'.

    Therefore, while Issue 1 dealt with who can approach the Court (locus standi), Issue 2 deals with whether the specific remedies under Articles 226 and 227 are the appropriate mechanisms for the Court to intervene in this particular type of governmental action and decision-making process.

    Does this clarification address Your Lordship's query? May I proceed with the substantive arguments on why the writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 might not be maintainable in this specific instance?"

Judge: `<None>`

Respondent: May it please Your Lordship,

Further to distinguishing between the maintainability of the petition as a Public Interest Litigation (Issue 1) and its maintainability specifically under Articles 226 and 227 (Issue 2), the Respondent submits the following:

While Article 226 confers wide powers upon this Hon'ble Court to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and for 'any other purpose', judicial review of administrative action, particularly concerning complex policy decisions involving socio-economic considerations and technical expertise, such as the construction of a dam to combat drought and the grant of environmental clearance, is traditionally circumscribed. The Petitioners, by challenging the environmental clearance and the policy decision itself, are essentially inviting this Hon'ble Court to delve into the merits and technical adequacy of the decision, an area where courts generally exercise restraint, intervening only on grounds of illegality, irrationality (Wednesbury unreasonableness), or procedural impropriety.

Furthermore, the reliance on Article 227 appears misplaced in the present context. Article 227 grants this Hon'ble Court the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. This power is primarily intended to ensure that subordinate courts and tribunals act within the bounds of their authority. It is not typically invoked to challenge the executive policy decisions of the State Government or administrative orders such as the environmental clearance granted by the Ministry, which are not judicial or quasi-judicial acts of subordinate courts or tribunals.

Therefore, while the Petitioners may have locus standi to bring matters of public interest before the Court (Issue 1), the specific challenge mounted against a policy decision and an expert clearance under the writ jurisdiction of Articles 226 and 227 (Issue 2) may not be appropriate, given the nature of the decision and the limited scope of judicial review, particularly under Article 227.
May I proceed to address Issue number 3, Your Lordship?

Judge: Counsel, you argue that judicial review under Article 226 is circumscribed, intervening only on grounds like illegality, irrationality, or procedural impropriety. The Petitioner alleges, inter alia, a lack of proper Environmental Impact Assessment and absence of genuine public consultation. Why do you contend that these specific allegations, even if taken prima facie at this stage, do not meet the threshold of irrationality or procedural impropriety sufficient to warrant the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction under Article 226?

Respondent: "Your Lordship, the Respondent acknowledges the gravity of the Petitioner's allegations concerning the Environmental Impact Assessment and public consultation. However, we contend that these allegations, even viewed prima facie, do not meet the established threshold of irrationality or procedural impropriety necessary to invoke this Hon'ble Court's extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226, for the following reasons:

Firstly, regarding the Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC), it was granted by the competent authority, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, presumably after following the mandated procedures. The mere assertion by the Petitioner that the EIA was improper, or that they disagree with its conclusions, does not automatically render the decision granting the ECC irrational in the Wednesbury sense. Irrationality requires a decision 'so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it'. The grant of clearance, explicitly stated to be in the larger public interest of addressing severe water scarcity, suggests a balancing exercise was undertaken by the competent authority. Disputing the outcome of this technical assessment does not, by itself, demonstrate irrationality or a fundamental procedural flaw warranting Article 226 intervention at this stage.

Secondly, concerning the alleged lack of genuine public consultation, the facts indicate the State was aware of the villagers' concerns and the potential displacement. The decision to proceed with the dam despite opposition reflects a policy choice, weighing the immediate impact on the villagers against the broader, long-term public interest of alleviating a state-wide water crisis and drought conditions. While the quality or extent of consultation might be debatable, this falls short of demonstrating a complete absence of consideration or a procedural impropriety so fundamental as to vitiate the entire decision-making process. The State, in exercising its executive function, is often required to make difficult choices between competing interests. Unless the Petitioner can demonstrate that the process was a mere sham or fundamentally flawed, violating statutory requirements or principles of natural justice to the point of irrationality, the Court's intervention under Article 226 is not warranted merely because a section of the public remains opposed or feels inadequately consulted.

Therefore, Your Lordship, while these issues are central to the merits of the case, they involve complex factual assessments and policy considerations. They do not, at this preliminary stage, demonstrate the kind of patent illegality, manifest irrationality, or egregious procedural impropriety that justifies the exercise of this Court's writ jurisdiction to interfere with the State's policy decision and the environmental clearance granted by the competent authority. May I proceed with further submissions on Issue 2, Your Lordship?"


Respondent: "Your Lordship, the Respondent acknowledges the gravity of the Petitioner's allegations concerning the Environmental Impact Assessment and public consultation. However, for the purpose of maintainability under Article 226, the threshold for judicial intervention on grounds of irrationality or procedural impropriety is significantly high, particularly concerning policy decisions involving technical expertise.
The fact remains that the Environmental Clearance Certificate was granted by the competent statutory authority, the Ministry of Environment and Forest. This grant creates a presumption, albeit rebuttable, that the necessary procedures were followed. While the Petitioner disputes the adequacy and genuineness of these processes, these are assertions that challenge the merits of the clearance, requiring detailed factual scrutiny and evidence.
At this preliminary stage of maintainability, the mere allegation of deficiencies, without demonstrating manifest arbitrariness or a complete breakdown of the procedural framework that meets the stringent Wednesbury standard, does not automatically render the State's action susceptible to judicial review under Article 226 to the extent of declaring the petition non-maintainable. The existence of the clearance process, undertaken by the designated body, suggests a level of procedural compliance was attempted. Whether that compliance was sufficient or legally sound is precisely what needs to be adjudicated during the substantive hearing on Issues 5 and 6, rather than forming a basis to deny the petition's maintainability under Article 226 at the outset.
Therefore, while we maintain that judicial review should be exercised with restraint in policy matters, we submit that the Petitioner's specific allegations regarding EIA and consultation are matters going to the merits of the environmental clearance, rather than demonstrating a prima facie case of irrationality or procedural impropriety so egregious as to preclude the petition's maintainability under Article 226."
